The use this for records &amp; there is no charge to your room for parking. We stayed for almost 1 week. Without exaggerating we probably left the parking garage 20-30 times over our stay &amp; never had a charge for it.

We were just a block or two off the strip - in a prime location - right in the middle. We rented a car at the airport so we could do some side trips, so we did not actually walk to the strip. Most of the hotels have free parking, so we did not incur any additional parking costs. Our condo was fabulous behind gates with a guard, and underground parking with a remote for the gates. The condo was totally redone with travertine floors, granite in the kitchen as well as stainless appliances, modern furnishings and very comfortable beds. With three TV's, there was plenty of opportunties for different TV shows and quiet naps at the same time. We never got a chance to spend time at the pool, but it was lovely. We will definately stay here again - it was fabulous, and away from the madness of the strip."

The room was spacious. We were on the 8th Avenue side 10th floor. I would ask for the other side opposite 8th Ave to get a quieter room. The breakfast was very good and the staff worked hard to keep the food items full and the area clean. The location was perfect. We saw the Jersey Boys and the theater was around the corner on 52 st. 2 minute walk. Learn as much as you can about the transportation system. The bus and subways will save you a lot of walking and time."

It's in a very central location (ca 10 Min to the Basilica and the Old Montreal Downtown) and has very polite and good English-speaking service. The outside looks of the hotel and the rooms themselves are not ultra-luxurious, so if you look for luxury you may need to go somewhere else (and pay considerably more). For us, however, it was the perfect choice and the &quot;petite dejeuner&quot; (continental breakfast) sufficient for a good start in the morning. Parking was also easily found around the hotel (we parked on a Friday evening and there is free parking then available all around the hotel till Monday morning). If you really do not know where to park (which would be surprising to me) then the hotel can still offer you a day-pass at a nearby parking lot for Can-$ 10. The Wifi-internet was fast and reliable."

Smallish rooms on busy Lombard Street does provide some noise. If that is a problem for you, then look somewhere else. It was not for us, we are hard sleepers. The only real problem with this place is huge! There is No place to park. There are a few street parking spots available, but they are never available! We had to go park in a parking structure about 3 or 4 blocks away for $20 a day! So any money we saved by finding this place, we paid even more after paying for parking. I would recommend this place if you have no car to park, because it is a good value for this pricey city. But, if you have a car, please do not waste your time. There are many, many places on Lombard Street that have parking garages at there location for free."

They have valet parking at $45 plus tax and the internet is $10. When is Hyatt going to realise that wifi is here to stay and is getting cheaper everywhere - most of the hotels today offer it free and with the high room rates paid here why cant they include free wifi?

The Travelodge looked OK on TripAdvisor so booked the 3 nights I needed. Arrived before 12:00 and was told early check-in could only be investigated after 12:00, was not guaranteed, and would cost GBP10 extra if available. The place was not full, so there could well have been rooms available, but the horrible woman on the front desk was totally unhelpful. Once in, found the room clean but incredibly basic, with basically nothing in it that couldn't be nailed down. The parking was fine, but in all other respects, it was just barely acceptable."

We did so anyway, since we were told by the valet that nearby outdoor parking lots required us to move the car out at 6:30 every morning and there was no street parking available. We did not want the hassle. Now for the good: The hotel is located in a busy area of downtown but not in the center which is a 10 minute walk. The decor of the lobby was nice and clean and check -in was easy. Our room did not have a view but it was comfortable and cozy. The concierge was friendly and helpful in recommending nearby places to eat and we enjoyed getting our coffee at the downstairs Starbucks every morning. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay, except for the parking fee sticker shock. The best thing to do is not to drive into downtown San Francisco if possible. We would stay here again if we did not drive."

Hardly any amenities though i.e. free high speed wireless internet, only one restaurant choice(pricey), parking was OUTRAGEOUS!! It was more expensive to park than to rent the SUV. I know parking is very expensive in the city but...$45 per day is a rip-off!!! Other than that, I thought the hotel was very nice and clean."

Room was clean and the view was pretty awesome. It was great to have The Elephant and Castle (the Pub) right in the lobby of the hotel, they had an excellent beer selection, and super friendly staff. OH and the beds were really comfortable too! Parking, however, was a nightmare. The parking at the actual hotel was 48 dollars a night... OUCH! We elected to park at the public lot next door (the hospital lot) that was 34 dollars a night.. and for the 50 hours I was in Chicago it cost me $104 for parking.

The hotel did not disclose the $43.00 (Almost $50 with tax) nightly rate for parking. I spoke with numerous people about it including the General Manager who hung up on me when I asked for the name and number of his supervisor in Sheraton. In my opinion, they tease you with a good rate, then hit you with the parking fees to make up for it. Other nearby hotels charge from $20-30 per night so be sure to facter in parking with the 15% tax rate on it when you are determining your cost. When I called the Sheraton in New York, they offered to reduce the parking rate slightly, but by then I was so upset about what seemed like a bait and switch practice, I canceled the reservation and stayed at another nearby hotel - who only charged $20 per night!Just a word of warning - you'll get little or no sympathy or accomodation if you complain about anything at this place."

Parking is in the back of the hotel/timeshare. They are currently buidling a parking garage. Since we are members of HGVC, we were placed on a high floor in tower two. Service was great. Everybody was very friendly, including the security officers driving around in the golf carts. We frequently saw security checking the parking lots and walking the property. This was a new buidling, so everything was in good condition. The only minus was that in our second bedroom, it appeared that someone had smoked in the room and you could smell the odor. It was mild, however still annoying, since the room was designated as a non-smoking room. Overall everything everybody said about the hotel is pretty much right on."

Great location with regard to Pier 39 but we had to walk around the corner &amp; down the street to get to our room which was in a totally different building from where we checked in! We were charged $3 more for parking than was listed on the hotel's web site and for some reason none of the personnel at the hotel had access to the web site to confirm and wouldn't refund our $3! I found that hard to believe! Isn't it worth $3 to keep your guests happy? The desk clerk's handwriting was illegible, so I had to ask her what the room number was and she gave me the wrong number! We were almost late for our event because of the slow service &amp; set up of the hotel. Also, no valet parking; only self parking for $35/night! (Web site shows $32)."

After reading all negative reviews I was ready to see horrible place with unfriendly staff. But my experience was completely opposite! I was very surprised to find friendly staff, responsive to our special requests. The place is pet friendly, not easy to find. Free parking is a great, considering street parking is almost impossible to find. The room is small, but clean with plasma TV. Street noise level was not bad at all. Location is great with a lot of great restaurants and businesses. Walking distance to Exploratorium. Short bus ride to Fisherman's Wharf. Bottom line: If you expect to find Ritz Carlton amenities this hotel is not for you. Otherwise its a great inexpensive place to stay."

Great Location in downtown Chicago. Within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions. The service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly. The breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded. I recommend going early. The rooms were quiet and clean. I highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying &gt;2-3 days. We would stay here again. Parking is expensive, about $28/day. It is valet. The cheapest self parking I could find in the area was $24/days so we did valet parking. The valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly. This is my 3rd experience with Homewood Suites (3 different cities). I have had a great experience each time."

It's in a very central location (ca 10 Min to the Basilica and the Old Montreal Downtown) and has very polite and good English-speaking service. The outside looks of the hotel and the rooms themselves are not ultra-luxurious, so if you look for luxury you may need to go somewhere else (and pay considerably more). For us, however, it was the perfect choice and the &quot;petite dejeuner&quot; (continental breakfast) sufficient for a good start in the morning. Parking was also easily found around the hotel (we parked on a Friday evening and there is free parking then available all around the hotel till Monday morning). If you really do not know where to park (which would be surprising to me) then the hotel can still offer you a day-pass at a nearby parking lot for Can-$ 10. The Wifi-internet was fast and reliable."

To our surprise the hotel was, although very centrally located, easy to find by car from the airport. There is no parking place at the hotel it self so you can choose from valet parking to other local parking places. Either way it costs al lot of money (expect 24-29 USD per 24 hours). That was the only downside. The hotel is very centrally located and a perfect start to explore San Francisco. The rooms are small but clean. The staff is very friendly and helpfull. We left very early ( 06:00 am)at the last day and we could make our own breakfast to take with us. Breakfast is good but simple. If you're looking for an average but very central accomodation do not hesitate."

This is one of those traditional and centrally located landmark hotels, where I stayed due to favorable rates to my Company. Average room and comfortable bed, but the lack of alternative to valet parking was enough for me to not ever stay there again! They take your car and give you a tiny blue paper, which you cannot lose, otherwise they cannot find your car when you need it back. This is particularly annoying if you like to get in and out of the hotel multiple times a day, and need to go through this every single time they need to park or retrieve their car. As if this were not enough, the hotel will charge you an additional $26 CAN per day for parking! If staying in downtown Montreal, try something less fancy near Crescent Street, or in Old Town Montreal."

We sat at our table for 45 minutes before we finally retreated back to our room hungry. Ordered KFC and it arrived in 15 minutes. Next night the room service was also terrible 1hour 45 minutes for wings and nachos. Could not fit my truck in the hotel parking, it is for vehicles less than 6 feet. Had to pay $20 A day for valet parking and one night my truck literally blocked the sidewalk. With some scratches. On the morning we were leaving I had to wait 2 hours to get my truck from the &quot;valet&quot; parking. Seems someone lost the keys to the vehicle in front of me which were all parked in an alley. Will never stay there again. At $230 a night I expected much more."

My two nights were average, no complaint, no compliments really, just what an average stay should be. It is located close enough to all the downtown places and I must say that Montreal seemed busy at all hours. My room was on a non smoking section and also had a note about no loud noise overnight, which was cool. Parking was the only issue. I found a spot but the underground garage is quite tight and does not seem to have too many spots so I left the car there and walked when needed. It did say that the hotel validated parking but still charged you so that was confusing. Validating to me meant that if you stayed at the place, it was free. Parking was $17 a day I believe, wow. So, all in all the place was fine, clean and acceptable and close enough to walk to stores and restaurants, even the Bell Center which is about a mile away."

The room was very small which i knew beforehand but it was clean and good enough for a couple of days. I had big hassles getting out of the hotel though as there is no where to park and load up the car and i had to park down the street and try to ring up and pay for parking even though i was leaving and only wanted to grab my cases and go. I tried ringing and ended up spending a heap more $$ on the phone call than the parking fee. I was really annoyed as all i wanted to do was go and i thought it was all ridiculous. They should get special permission for a drop off/pickup bay. it is in a good location, near Hyde park and Oxford St."

We normally stay at the Starwood hotels and the Westin on Michigan Ave embodies the reason why we keep coming back. From the bell boy to the front desk to housekeeping service, the service and staff are impeccable and meticulous to every detail. One feels like royalty staying at the Westin on Michigan Ave. I will say one thing about the parking which, at $49 every 24 hrs (unlimited in/out privileges), is a little steep even for the area. My husband and I drove around and found a self park on the corner of DeWitt and Chestnut (next to 247 E. Chestnut apartments), about 2.5 blocks away which charged $28/day. The only thing that there are no in/out privileges but you are saving $21/day parking here over the hotel parking."

We booked this hotel through hotels.com and were happy with our stay. We had initially booked a standard King room but when we got there and asked for a room with a view they gave us a deluxe double queen room with a view. It was close to the elevator so we could hear it going up and down but that did not bother us too much since we are deep sleepers! Our room did not have a safe so we did end up leaving out laptop etc with the Bellman. The location was great since it was central to everything including the BART which we took to and from the SFO airport. The hotel offers parking which is $48/night with in and out privileges. We were able to find street parking for the night which cost us nothing. You just need to pay attention to the street cleaning signs and parking meter rules. Overall an excellent hotel with a great view."

The comfort/amenities is probably a couple of notches below that of a Marriot Residence Inn. The hotel is between Cumberland and Harlem stations of the CTA train- both with Park N Ride. There is also a mall along Harlem Ave, about 5-10 minutes drive. Hotel pool was clean but there were a lot of noisy guests using it during our stay. Breakfast is okay, bagels, cereals, sausage, fruits, waffles etc. There are ample of free parking spaces above ground and in the basement. Problem with basement parking is you need to drive out the highway to other side of hotel to access entrace. Basement parking is very tight but car seems more secure because it has garage doors. Would stay here again if in Chicago."

We had phoned ahead and were told by reservations staff that hotel parking was $45/day. Turned out to be $51. Should have gotten car out immediately but was too tired.

The onlt thing I can really complain about is the parking charge. Not only is it 28$ per day but it is not even guaranteed parking. So, if there is no space you have to bring your ticket back to the front desk and tell them not ot charge you, and make SURE they do not cuz they tried to charge me for 2 days in which I did not park in the hotel garage and then we had to argue about it. In the end they took the fees off. And here's a pointer - on the weekends the parking is free on the street so park on Friday night and leave your car there all weekend and avoid the charges! There's no reason to use your car in San Francisco anyway. SO, all in all, no major problems here, just a couple of pointers to save some bucks!"

Rates are budgeted around $50-$90... and the rooms look like their newly remodeled..which included a microwave, refridgerator, and a little cofee maker... their rooms start on the second floor, first floor is all parking... unfortunatly they have no elevators...taking the stairs were not that bad..but i would prefer an elevator anytime.... The hotel also started offering FREE HIGH SPEED INTERNET! they have not advertised that amenity anywhere on their website or even in their room which i thought was weird.

We booked the &quot;premier queen&quot; rooms. These are supposed to be their best rooms they have next to a suite. Well, I think some are better than others, but if our rooms were just adequate I'm not sure what the standard rooms would be like. It's located a few blocks further from the main shopping and dining attractions than other downtown hotels and as such is price a little lower than similar hotels. The best deal of all is that parking, which can be very expensive in San Francisco, was only $10 a day with a promotional package. The regular parking is $20/day which is still cheaper than many. When you compare hotel room costs in San Franciso, if you need parking for a car, be sure to find out how much it is at each hotel. One hotel we liked alot charged $42.50 per day. That adds a lot to the daily cost."

The one outrageous price was hotel parking. C$30/day! The only time where I remember paying more is at the Time-Warner building in NYC. If you stay at this RC because it is a good value, do not blow your savings on hotel parking. There are lots of parking garages in the neighborhood that are probably a lot cheaper."

When you book there is a little disclaimer that some hotels charge for parking. In San Fransisco this is kind of common. But this motle had absolutely no parking at all. We arrived late around 6:30 and were told to park on the street (but not to leave anything in our car or it would be broken into.) We drove around and around for quite sometime and found nothing! We finally ended up parking in a garage 3 blocks away. We were told it would cost $9 but when we returned to pick up our car the next morning we were actually charged $15! This is quite a bit aoncsidering we only paid $50 for the room. Also, the room was right on Lombard St ans EXTREMELY noisy. And to make matters worse, there was no A/C so we had to open the windows. It was Jan but so incredible hot due to the radiator which we could not adjust. Room was small but clean and there was a decent breakfast."

They auto-upgraded us to a premium room when we arrived for the same price. However, we grew up in the 60s without things like fans in the bathroom and surround-sound type showers. If you are looking for ultra-modern this is not the hotel for you. If you are looking for a good bargain, clean rooms, and a nice, safe place to stay, I highly recommend this hotel. Be aware, though, that you do pay for parking at this hotel. The parking prices are in line with public parking places. ($20 + tax a day) and are not included in the room price. But the garage is easy access, safe and you can park on the same floor as the lobby."

So at this rate it was a great value and a great location. We were provided a south facing room on the 32nd floor. Staff was great. Only minor complaint was the parking. We had phoned ahead and were told by reservations staff that hotel parking was $45/day. Turned out to be $51. Should have gotten car out immediately but was too tired. Discovered there were several garages behind the hotel in the $35-40 range. Told front desk staff that since the valet parking is not part of the hotel they should advise guests of the lower cost alternatives."

The onlt thing I can really complain about is the parking charge. Not only is it 28$ per day but it is not even guaranteed parking. So, if there is no space you have to bring your ticket back to the front desk and tell them not ot charge you, and make SURE they do not cuz they tried to charge me for 2 days in which I did not park in the hotel garage and then we had to argue about it. In the end they took the fees off. And here's a pointer - on the weekends the parking is free on the street so park on Friday night and leave your car there all weekend and avoid the charges! There's no reason to use your car in San Francisco anyway. SO, all in all, no major problems here, just a couple of pointers to save some bucks!"

The location was such that we could maneuver the streets of San Francisco and yet find our way back to our room. That's very important if you've ever tried to drive in downtown San Francisco!The hotel room was immaculate and it was very quiet. Our room over-looked the courtyard. The hotel staff was always very friendly and helpful. The parking garage was a little crazy but I got the feeling that would be true for any of the parking garages. We were able to find spaces that were near the elevator going right in to the hotel. And another plus to this hotel - the parking fee was for &quot;in &amp; out&quot; parking. Evidently some places charge for parking each time you leave and for each time you returnWe would definately stay at this hotel again."

We had not booked hotels for our travels, relying on last minute bookings in an attempt to get good value deals and not blow out the budget. Chose the Oasis primarly due to the free security carparking (car parking can cost a bomb in San Fran).Rooms are very basis and badly worn and the hotel is situated well off out of &quot;tourist&quot; areas. This hotel would appear to be linked to a French Tour company, as many of the occupants are French tourists. Basically if you want a cheap hotel with secure and free parking, well this will do, but beware whilst clean and comfortable, this is 2 star hotel at best, in a less than ideal area - I would not walk around outside after dark."

We had problems finding the hotel parking garage, and were rushed out of our car so the valet could park it. We were shocked the next morning when we discovered that our parking fee (with taxes) was $43. We had only been parked there for about 16 hours. While we were waiting for our car to be brought down, we saw the sign we had missed the day before that listed the parking charge.

We had to carry all our luggage out of the hotel and walk around to the back of the hotel to get to where the vehicle was. Very poor setup. I only found this out by coincidence. Also my husband was attending a course at Mcgill and I was hoping for a late checkout and all 3 times we've staying there they would not give me past 12:00. They were knocking at my door at 12:05 wondering when I'd be out. The rooms are a nice size and seems to be quite clean. It is also very conveniently located for everything."

The lobby is VERY tacky looking. The room we stayed in was appaulingly small. The bathroom is so small that you literally had to hang your feet into the bathtub to use the washroom. They also have no parking and no parking recommendations for you. For 3 nights we ended up having to pay $51 for parking. The hotel restaurant is Japanese only so if your not into that, then your screwed. Overall, I found the whole experience terrible, the staff not friendly at all and even though everything appeared clean, it felt very dirty."

We paid $120 a night for what we were told was a very nice, large room. The room was smaller than any hotel room I'd ever seen. The carpets were gross, there was NO parking (and I had been guaranteed parking when I called as I knew we were arriving at midnight on a Friday). After 7 hours of driving and just wanting to get settled, I arrived and was told I had to drive around crowded city streets and try to find an open lot with space. I never saw any sort of breakfast. We ended up cancelling the rest of the nights and went to the Holiday Inn. It was the same price for a very nice exective room in a clean hotel with concierge, an indoor pool, gym, sauna, parking and city views. I can't believe the Quartier Latin was charging as much."

How many times have we all stayed in a big city hotel and thought we were getting a deal only to find that we had to pay another $30 plus tips for parking. And this parking is fenced. King bed. Fine. A little hard. But fitted sheets! Small TV. Old-fashioned bathroom, but fine. Art deco doorway that was really cool. Sub-par breakfast. Toast and corn flakes really with nonfat milk. With cheese and good quality milk for coffee and cereal next day that we brought, it was much better."

We loved the suite-it was huge, but did have that old musty smell that other postings spoke about. The breakfast was o.k., and so was the service. I also wish they would have told me that the parking package didnt include all that it said on the website, e.g.-that evening drinks and snacks are not included, since the bar and restaurant are being renovated. Although they did manage to provide breakfast. But, all in all we loved the charm and ambience of this old world hotel."

I was on a budget,and that blew my budget all to hell. Beware that parking is alot extra... the hotel it is self was fine... my room was a bit small but what the heck do you expect for one of the cheapest nights stay in Chicago...

Being that it was next to the China town gate (the fire escape litterally has you looking straight down to it) and walking distance to Union Square and all public transportation, this was a great price!

The room was spacious and clean and the buffet breakfast was very tasty. The staff were extreemly pleasant and caring and the checkin was fast. My one major disapointment was that there was no parking at the hotel. I had to park accross the road in an upmarket apartment complex. The cost of the parking from evening to the following morning was nearly half the price of the hotel room so it was very expensive. Parking is available on the street but car wouldnt not be safe overnight outside. Overall enjoyed the whole experience but the parking was a disapointment."

There is a parking ramp across the street that is MUCH cheaper then hotel parking. Really fun happy hour each afternoon with wine and treats. great time to talk to other travelers and find out their favorite things to do in the area. Honestly, San Fran was our favorite trip ever. Can't wait to return."

We got the regular room with two twin beds and it was perfect! This room cost about $70 a night along with $20 a day parking garage fees. Being that it was next to the China town gate (the fire escape litterally has you looking straight down to it) and walking distance to Union Square and all public transportation, this was a great price! Dont forget to ask about the $20 parking because if you dont you will pay up to $35 a day for parking....the hotel and parking garage have a contract together. There is not very good Wi-Fi in the hotel but there are tons of places nearby that offer it for free like the starbucks across the way and a nearby borders. It wasnt a fancy hotel but offered bare essentials. San Fran is a big city so expect nose whereever you stay."

I wanted to stay in a suite at one of the more smaller hotels (boutique) or even the Omni. The room was small and the bay view was very limited. Also, although we had reservations, when we arrived we only had a choice of the second floor or the 8th floor, which was the smoking floor. The hotel's lobby is huge and beautiful, but they truly did not splurge on the rooms. The reception stated that the hotel caters to conventions and that is exactly what it felt like. The BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT, however was the hefty valet parking (there is no self parking). Parking per night was $41.00 plus a tax, which ended up being almost $50.00. For a three night stay it cost us $147.00 total for parking alone. My next stay will NOT be at the Hyatt Regency with all of the other hotels available."

We booked the Allerton through Priceline for 5 nights in July. When checking in we were offered a free upgrade to a larger room. I must admit that this &quot;larger&quot; room was still quite small, but this would be expected from an older hotel in downtown Chicago. The key for me is the hotel and the room were exceptionally clean. The staff was friendly and always greated us when we walked in. Parking is quite expensive when using the vallet service. I recommend parking yourself. There is a parking ramp that is $13 cheaper per night a block away. All around a nice place to stay."

The location was such that we could maneuver the streets of San Francisco and yet find our way back to our room. That's very important if you've ever tried to drive in downtown San Francisco!The hotel room was immaculate and it was very quiet. Our room over-looked the courtyard. The hotel staff was always very friendly and helpful. The parking garage was a little crazy but I got the feeling that would be true for any of the parking garages. We were able to find spaces that were near the elevator going right in to the hotel. And another plus to this hotel - the parking fee was for &quot;in &amp; out&quot; parking. Evidently some places charge for parking each time you leave and for each time you returnWe would definately stay at this hotel again."

The Hyatt is a perfectly nice, above average hotel, but is not special. While in our room, we could have been in any city, but our view was decent &amp; we spent most of our time out and about. Transportation is nearby &amp; there is lots to see and do within walking distance. One downside... the parking is extremely expensive, even if you are a guest. I would recommend parking down a couple of blocks in a parking structure. We really enjoyed our stay &amp; could not have found a better hotel for the price we paid."

Valet parking is $47 a day, which is bordering on absurd. I parked the car myself in the same lot the second day for $25. They did charge me for 2 days of valet parking, but corrected the bill without any question. I did not fond the rooms to be so small. Every room seems to have a great view.

The price for parking, however, was outrageous. It cost us more to park ($39.00 plus tax) than we paid for our rental car. The cost for parking whether you used valet or parked the car yourself was the same. When we complained on the way out to a member of the staff, his response was that in New York City it is way more, but we were not in New York City. If you want to be near Fisherman's Wharf, the location was ideal."

The other suites or mini suites have no views, i.e., view of the parking lot and loading area, and are somehow smallish and not very well designed. Anyways, my stay in the suite at the end of the 13rd floor hallway was memorable. It was nicely furnished and distributed, the view on the city and the mountain was gorgeous. The foie gras from the room service was delicious, I had it twice. Got wrongly charged two nights of parking after checking-out, but staff at the accounting dept. refunded my credit card quickly.

I had to park my car and get my own luggage going down the walkway to the front desk and do my check-in. There is no space in the entrance of the hotel that allow you to drop off the luggage and come back for it. Also, although I did not have any problems, the staff on the parking garage is not friendly at all. I would come back to this hotel for the good deal on their price and cleaness but will look for another parking. I notice that there are other parking in the same block and they did not not bad as this one."

Was looking for a hotel with good Christmas decor, swimming pool and overnight parking nearby. San Francisco hotels normally charge over $40 minimum a night for parking. There was Hearst parking next door ($20 for a 24hr period) ; no in-out previleges but was good enough for me and also has a CPK in the same buliding. About 10 minute walk to Bloomingdales and San Francisco Shopping Center. The rooms are nice with LCD HDTV with actual HD channels including HBO. The Christmas decor was very nice in the lobby and the restaurant. Had a traditional European feel to it. Kids loved it. Swimming pool is nice and indoor but the was definitely not warm and a little bit salty, yuk. Kids had fun nonethless, so, apart fron the pool everything else was good. Will probably return for my other kid's birthday."

We decided to stay here to avoid the crowds and traffic. It you are looking for something a little away from it and quiet this is your hotel. You do not have to worry about getting taken for parking fees like the downtown places. The neighborhood is clean and great for walks/jogs in the AM. There is no parking fee and parking near the hotel was never a problem there was always parking just east on Broderick.

The one outrageous price was hotel parking. C$30/day! The only time where I remember paying more is at the Time-Warner building in NYC. If you stay at this RC because it is a good value, do not blow your savings on hotel parking. There are lots of parking garages in the neighborhood that are probably a lot cheaper."

The only problem is parking. Beware, I did not read in reviews that their parking garage at the hotel can fill up. We had to drop off luggage then drive around the corner to Anchorage Parking Garage to store our car at $30 per night (24 hour parking, no in/out). It actually worked out fine because you'll either want to walk to Fisherman's wharf or ride a taxi to other locations, but just a warning. I was not expecting to not be able to park at the hotel. Other than that we had a great time and worth the money to stay close to where you are going to be. We took a tour and went to 50 different movie sites, it was awesome! We wished we had more time to go out to Alcatraz, if you get here and see it, you'll know why."

We recently booked a two-night stay at the Hyatt Regency, Embarcardero Center, through Hotwire and got what appeared to be a great deal. (We were charged $109 plus tax per night.) When we arrived at the hotel the valet told us (to our horror) that the charge for parking at the hotel was $57 per day! Given that Hotwire does not release the name of the hotel or charges for hotel &quot;INCIDENTALS&quot; (which apparently parking is considered) prior to paying for the room, we were taken completely by surprise. And given the non-refundable nature of Hotwire bookings, we were stuck paying the $114 to park for two nights. We fully expected to pay around $25/day for parking, but to charge more than half of the cost of the room itself is highway robbery.. The hotel was nice enough, but we won't be going back - EVER.."

The renovation and the tower rooms are just wonderful. Service was great and it is one of the best of the Westin properties. We wanted to slip in some shopping between other activities, and Union Square made this really easy. Plus it was pouring and being able to rush back and get out of the rain was really helpful. We had stayed in S.F. Le Meridien in the financial district/embarcadero last month and did notice that the St. Francis was not as well equipped or as spacious, but the location is what we needed this weekend. My only complaint about the St. Francis is the parking at $49 a night plus taxes is just ridiculous. Even the expensive hotels in S.F. are less. Guests should get a break on parking. I find I am reconsidering SPG hotels for the high charges for internet access parking which add considerably to costs. Many modern hotels have WIFI ."

I had made reservations at the Belleclaire for about $200 a night and after talking to some people who live and work in the city, we the OTA is much nicer. No complaints about the room - superior king. Bathroom was in great shape and clean. Staff was helpful - we were able to check out bags upon checkout in the morning and pick them up later in the afternoon at no charge. Great diner right next door - the Manhatten Diner - where we ate breakfast for $17 including the tip. The only issue was the parking. We arrived late Saturday afternoon and the garages close by I had checked out on BestParking.com for $40 a night were full. Parked about 3 blocks away for $55. The hotel does have a &quot;parking package&quot; I may consider using next time."

Great place for coffee and breakfast. My only complaint is the $48 a day parking. Ouch! There is a much more reasonable parking garage down the street if you do not want to pay this exorbitant price.

We did not want the hassle. Now for the good: The hotel is located in a busy area of downtown but not in the center which is a 10 minute walk. The decor of the lobby was nice and clean and check -in was easy. Our room did not have a view but it was comfortable and cozy. The concierge was friendly and helpful in recommending nearby places to eat and we enjoyed getting our coffee at the downstairs Starbucks every morning. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay, except for the parking fee sticker shock. The best thing to do is not to drive into downtown San Francisco if possible.

You have your choice of odering off of the menu or the buffet. I would recommend the buffet. The breakfast was good, but I wouldn't have paid the menu price for it if it were not in our package.

If your business takes you to the downtown area of Chicago, this place is a must. This hotel sits on Michigan Ave and within walking distance to all of the great shopping located on the Magnificient 5/8 mile. The hotel is average on appearance. The lobby offers a nice sit down area, bar, and coffee shop. The rooms are SMALL in comparison to other Marriott's we have stayed. The rooms did not have coffee makers or hair dryers. The pool was a lap pool only 12'x38'. There is a nice work out room that offers cycles and free weights. Valet parking is offered for $35 a day or self parking for $22 a day. We opted for self parking and found it to be a bargain as we walked or bussed to all of tourist locations. Overall, I would rate this hotel as average due to the small rooms, lack of a swimming pool, no coffee pots or hair dryers."

They also gave us free parking for the mix-up, which was a nice bonus considering the usual price. Parking is $50 a night, but I had rented an SUV - $80 a night for oversized vehicles!! WOW!! There is a much cheaper parking garage just a block down the street - they can direct you to it. Anyhow, we were very pleased with our 2 rooms. Typical Marriott rooms. Good size and very comfortable. We decided to splurge on the breakfast buffet. It's expensive, but good. The bar/restaurant at the top has great views. The hotel is in a great location for shopping and restaurants.

Subway to go downtown is close by but you need to good through a tunnel (which is slightly smelly and somebody sleeps there at night). Taxi to go downtown is around $10.If you choose the signature room, it is pretty spacious with a queen and sofa beds almost at the same price. Some rooms have a pretty good view of downtown. If you book through AAA/CAA, it costs you a premium but includes parking and breakfast. Depending on the number of occupants, it may worth it.

The location was not bad, really accessible to Pier 39, The Embarcadero and North Beach. The HDTV was nice and the room was nice. But that was not enough to make our stay any pleasant at all. The minute we got there and was informed that the daily parking was $43 plus tax. Turned out to be $49 a night just for parking. That was pathetic. I've never parked anywhere in san francisco where parking was over $30. This ruined everything. I do not know , it did not seem like the parking fee caused any complaints. I just wanted word out to whoever is going to make a future booking here, to be aware of the close to $50 daily parking fee. This was BS."

Other hotels can charge up to $50/day for parking, which completely destroys the cheap room rate. Very easy to get to (just exit off of I-90 and drive right to the door), room was clean, plenty of room for two, everything worked fine, bedding/towels were clean, decor was basic, view was OK, halls were sparse, elevators and stairs are very confusing, location is superb (right across the street from Rock and Roll McDonald's), continental breakfast was poor, parking may take a while to get your car out (the attendants will double-park cars), and the outside noise can be loud (sirens) at times if your window is open. Overall, not a place I would call elegant, but a great room based on location, price, and perfect for someone who just wants to use the room for sleeping and not hanging out."

Also, though our view including the flight path for the airport (kids loved it), you still could not hear any (jet) noise even with the window slightly open. Staff was helpful, bilingual, and greeted you with a smile. Though I am not sure what the other hotels around the airport offer, but I would recommend this facility to anybody needing accommodations near the airport. However the only complaint I have is the parking situation due to its location. There is only a dozen parking spaces located out front and the main parking lot was at the opposite end (from our room) of the building."

It is in good location to transit stops that will take you either to Fisherman's Wharf or Union Square. Parking however should be budgeted into your trip. The hotel's valet parking is 50 dollars a day plus tips. The parking at the 3 Embarcadero building is 30 dollars a day if you never remove your car. I'm unsure if this is normal for San Fran. Just make sure to budget parking into your hotel stay."

The staff person at the desk was very helpful, as we got to Montreal at 1:30 in the morning, and they even upgraded our room to a King size bed! The room itself was absolutely perfect, the bathroom spotless and in excellent repair. It had a marble shower as well as a bathtub,and it was all as clean as clean is possible. Even though it was a 'smoking' room, you could not smell any hint of cigarettes, and it was not stale from any artificial fragrance either. fyi, the internet usage in the business center is $5 per half hour, and the parking is $26 for the day(!), but do not drive in the city because the parking meters are even more expensive, and good luck finding parking. Take the 'metro' and buy yourself a day pass ($9) - it is well worth the money. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, and would go back in a heartbeat."

Overall, the place was very nice. Our room was very large with a very large bathroom. There was ample space to sit and relax, and the down bedding on the king-size bed was wonderful. However, one of the main reasons for booking here was the &quot;complimentary high speed internet&quot; which is necessary for my boyfriend and I when traveling as he is an editor and works from home. The internet connection was very slow and disconnected every couple of seconds, making it impossible to get any work done. We called for assistance and they said they would have the problem remidied within a few hours, but that never happened. Also, parking for this hotel was $39 per day. There is a public parking structure right down the street (a very easy walk) that offers overnight parking for half the price."

Just remember that you have to pay each time you come and go from the parking lot I think. At the hotel it is also valet parking from the front door.

Those now seem to be done and the hotel seems to be put back together. We were given an upgrade a check in and found the room we were given to be spacious and nicely appointed. My wife and I found the hotel to be very luxourious and in an excellent location to explore either the shopping district or the old port area of Montreal. My beef however is with the parking arrangements for the hotel. Firstly, hotel guests can only park on level 9 and lower so getting in and out of the garage is time consuming. Next getting from the parking to the hotel requires an evelator change and a bit of a walk to the front desk. If all that was not probelm enough, the hotel has no arrangement with the garage to allow for in and out priviledges. This means that trips to dinner etc. rack up significant parking charges. All in all its a very nice hotel but with a poor parking setup."

Unfriendly staff, not a pleasant experience. Room looked out onto an abandoned gravel lot with garbage in it. Parking was not mentioned to be a fee when booked. Couldn't park on the street (all restricted areas). Was initially told that parking was around the corner and in thru the wire fence. Couldn't locate parking so asked again to different person. Was then told parking was $15 and not provided by the hotel. Small unsecured lot. I was hoping that my car would still be there in the morning!!! Did not get accomodations I had made a reservation for. Reserved a king, got a queen. Shower curtain was tied back with a piece of toilet paper. Old mini-bar hidden in tv cabinet. Breakfast consisted of Croissants, juice and coffee. Better than nothing. Will never stay at an Econolodge again if this is what to expect."

If you think about using the pool, DON'T. They should think about burrying it and putting more parking space over it. It was very dirty. The room was clean but had a strong smell of carpet deodorant floating around, but we vented it out quickly by opening the window. This is a good hotel for the budget-oriented traveller because of the cheap rates and because it is located in a good neighborhood (Cow's Hollow). You could access everything by using public transit, but much easier with a car.. Bring lots of quarters for metered parking when you visit the city!!!"

My two nights were average, no complaint, no compliments really, just what an average stay should be. It is located close enough to all the downtown places and I must say that Montreal seemed busy at all hours. My room was on a non smoking section and also had a note about no loud noise overnight, which was cool. Parking was the only issue. I found a spot but the underground garage is quite tight and does not seem to have too many spots so I left the car there and walked when needed. It did say that the hotel validated parking but still charged you so that was confusing. Validating to me meant that if you stayed at the place, it was free. Parking was $17 a day I believe, wow. So, all in all the place was fine, clean and acceptable and close enough to walk to stores and restaurants, even the Bell Center which is about a mile away."

Didn't eat any meals there so do not know if it is good or not. The hotel really does not have anything fancy, but it is nicer than most 3-star hotels. The &quot;valet&quot; parking is really the parking garage on the corner.

We enjoyed the nice comfortable bed, cleanliness of the room and friendly staff. We found the concierge and front desk staff very helpful with directions and other assistance. The location is within close proximity of many of Montreal's attractions. The only downside was the parking which was $25 / day. We did not use this parking; instead we parked in the adjacent mall parking for $8 for 17 hours (you must pay again if you leave the lot, but with the Hyatt parking, you can come and go as you please, but at the higher rate) for one day, and parked across the street on the other days (this only works if you are gone during the day during a weekend stay since metered parking is $3/hr)."

I was very surprised to find friendly staff, responsive to our special requests. The place is pet friendly, not easy to find. Free parking is a great, considering street parking is almost impossible to find. The room is small, but clean with plasma TV. Street noise level was not bad at all. Location is great with a lot of great restaurants and businesses. Walking distance to Exploratorium. Short bus ride to Fisherman's Wharf. Bottom line: If you expect to find Ritz Carlton amenities this hotel is not for you. Otherwise its a great inexpensive place to stay."

To our surprise the hotel was, although very centrally located, easy to find by car from the airport. There is no parking place at the hotel it self so you can choose from valet parking to other local parking places. Either way it costs al lot of money (expect 24-29 USD per 24 hours). That was the only downside. The hotel is very centrally located and a perfect start to explore San Francisco. The rooms are small but clean. The staff is very friendly and helpfull. We left very early ( 06:00 am)at the last day and we could make our own breakfast to take with us. Breakfast is good but simple. If you're looking for an average but very central accomodation do not hesitate."

Also, parking does cost an extra $10 + tax (and you need to let them know ahead of time that you will require a space), and it was barely worth it for us as we checked in late and had to check out at noon. We almost would have been better off parking all day and night in one of the close garages as we had to move our car and pay for all-day parking anyway. But the location of this hotel is truly excellent and really it was not a bad experience overall."

We did not want to pay as much to park the car, as the hotel room. We got the parking package, which included unlimited in-and-out valet parking. All the staff we had contact with were fantastic, very enthusiastic and helpful, and clearly enjoyed their jobs. The rooms was very spacious, and having the mini kitchen (complete with salt and pepper, cutlery, crockery, coffee machine, microwave and frig) was a real bonus. It's not often you stay in a hotel with a large couch and an easy chair in a studio room. And the bed was oh, so comfy. Great location, only one block from Union Square. Will definitely go back when we next holiday in San Francisco."

Building, room, bathroom (washroom), room decor, and etc were in excellent conditions. One of the best Courtyards I have stayed in so far. Also, though our view including the flight path for the airport (kids loved it), you still could not hear any (jet) noise even with the window slightly open. Staff was helpful, bilingual, and greeted you with a smile. Though I am not sure what the other hotels around the airport offer, but I would recommend this facility to anybody needing accommodations near the airport. However the only complaint I have is the parking situation due to its location. There is only a dozen parking spaces located out front and the main parking lot was at the opposite end (from our room) of the building."

The staff are friendly and our room was clean. The room was a bit on the small side, but similar to a size you would get in Europe. The room faced an alley, but that was okay because it made it quiet at night. The hotel is probably better sealed against noise. There's no parking in the immediate location, but there are garages a block away. One of the cheaper parking garages is the Sutter/Stockton garage two blocks away. One thing the hotel does need to do is better enforce the no parking area just in front of their door. It's supposed to be for unloading/loading of luggage for guests, but there were cars parked there all the time. But the hotel staff were nice enough to go around the block where I had stopped to help with luggage."

Those now seem to be done and the hotel seems to be put back together. We were given an upgrade a check in and found the room we were given to be spacious and nicely appointed. My wife and I found the hotel to be very luxourious and in an excellent location to explore either the shopping district or the old port area of Montreal. My beef however is with the parking arrangements for the hotel. Firstly, hotel guests can only park on level 9 and lower so getting in and out of the garage is time consuming. Next getting from the parking to the hotel requires an evelator change and a bit of a walk to the front desk. If all that was not probelm enough, the hotel has no arrangement with the garage to allow for in and out priviledges. This means that trips to dinner etc. rack up significant parking charges. All in all its a very nice hotel but with a poor parking setup."

There were far too few handicapped spaces and virtually NO spaces of any kind if we got back after 10 PM. I would have to let her out and make her stand there by the door until I parked wqay in the back and came back to help her to our room. What is worse is that they are expanding.

They even hold your bags for you, which was really convenient for us as we checked out in the morning and took a tour of NY.The parking lot that they validate the parking for is about 2 blocks from the hotel - $24.00 for a day - Central parking.

We travel from out of state each year for a family reunion and we have found this hotel to be a good value in a very expensive neighborhood. That said, here are some pointers if you pick this hotel for your Fisherman's Wharf location. The parking is pricey, currently running at about $32.00 a day. There are cheaper public parking lots nearby so you will need to self park to save on parking. The hotel's restaurant is OK but there are so many very good restaurants in the area that we always eat elsewhere (even breakfast). Ask for a room that has been refurbished. Maybe all the rooms are done now but last year some of our relatives had &quot;old style&quot; rooms. Our room this year was fantastic and faced the pool. We loved it as the bed was very, very comfortable and the room was quiet and restful."

The location of the hotel is great. It was easy to take buses and cable cars from this hotel. The cable car stop was a short walk to Union Square. Plenty of places to eat near this hotel also. Mel's Diner is on the next corner. Room service was perfect. The food was delicious and hot. Everything we ordered from room service was delivered within 15 minutes. The parking garage was great too. Our kids had bikes for the parks and bridge which were stored in our auto. Everything in out truck was perfectly safe because the parking garage is manned by Palomar employees. I have never been in a nicer parking garage. All employees were very nice and extrememly helpful. Our room was spotless and a great size. I would stay at this hotel anytime I am in San Fran and would recommend it to anyone."

When we checked out the bags were carried to the parking garage next door. The parking rate was discounted for guests. Get your parking stub validated by the hotel before picking up the car. The room was spacious. We were on the 8th Avenue side 10th floor. I would ask for the other side opposite 8th Ave to get a quieter room. The breakfast was very good and the staff worked hard to keep the food items full and the area clean. The location was perfect. We saw the Jersey Boys and the theater was around the corner on 52 st. 2 minute walk. Learn as much as you can about the transportation system. The bus and subways will save you a lot of walking and time."

Bad things are: the water pressure for the sink &amp; shower go from low pressure to normal pressure every min or so, and when it does in the shower, the water gets scalding hot. The most important thing in a hotel to me is the bathroom &amp; it was just beyond terrible. They have a soap/shampoo dispenser too, not even actual shampoo bottles &amp; ect. Crazy. Skip this place, pay for parking elsewhere. You won't have people blocking you in where you cannot get out &amp; you won't have these terrible bathrooms. Oh, we also booked a 2 bed room &amp; when we got there, they said we did a 1 king bed, which was BS, &amp; then we had to get a 2 bed smoking room because they did not have a non-smoking (even though we reserved one).

Liked the wine, beer, and soft drinks happy hour, the proximity to all points of interest in Fisherman's Wharf, the cable cars, grocery stores, gym, etc. This is a real find. Nice Italian restaurant in hotel, too. Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night. This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking. Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed."

On arrival it became clear that parking wasnt included. I was advised that I could park in their carpark at a cost of 12- but unfortunatly there were not any spaces available. The rooms were clean and spacious, with a standard buffet style breakfast. Ive also stayed at the Express near the MIllenium Dome, which I would recomed over this one. Free parking for a start!I probably wont book with Express again though - they've put their prices up recenty. Some of them by an additional 50 per night. Used to be a good hotel chain offering good value for money, a touch up the range from Premier Travel Inn. However..You can now stay at a Hilton Hotel for the same price!"

The lobby is VERY tacky looking. The room we stayed in was appaulingly small. The bathroom is so small that you literally had to hang your feet into the bathtub to use the washroom. They also have no parking and no parking recommendations for you. For 3 nights we ended up having to pay $51 for parking. The hotel restaurant is Japanese only so if your not into that, then your screwed.

There was Hearst parking next door ($20 for a 24hr period) ; no in-out previleges but was good enough for me and also has a CPK in the same buliding. About 10 minute walk to Bloomingdales and San Francisco Shopping Center. The rooms are nice with LCD HDTV with actual HD channels including HBO. The Christmas decor was very nice in the lobby and the restaurant. Had a traditional European feel to it. Kids loved it. Swimming pool is nice and indoor but the was definitely not warm and a little bit salty, yuk. Kids had fun nonethless, so, apart fron the pool everything else was good. Will probably return for my other kid's birthday."

The carpeting looked brand-new as did the wallpaper, furniture, etc. Bathroom was a good size with a good shower. Only negative is that the breakfast area is quite small considering the size of the hotel. We choose not to stand-in line to wait for food and what appeared to be a wait for a table. There is a Corner Bakery just a couple of blocks away that was very good and very reasonably priced. We chose to self-park rather than pay for valet parking. We parked at the East Monroe Millennium Parking Garage off of Columbus Avenue ($23/24 hours). Very easy walk from the hotel to the parking garage."

The motel is located on Lombard Street, just 6 blocks away from the crooked part. You can walk to Fisherman's Wharf in about :15. Of the many positives, I would have to say that their BEST attraction is that they offer free parking to overnight guests. The majority of the hotels and motels we researched charged anywhere from $15-$30 a night just to park your car in their parking lot! With parking in San Francisco being difficult to find, we felt this was an amazing plus. There are two great shopping districts within walking distance. One to the west of the motel and the other to the east. The area is not ritzy and has a ton of motels, but if you're looking for low price with cleanliness this is your place. Also, the customer service was outstanding and the housekeepers did an EXCELLENT job at keeping our room extremely clean."

Decent price compared to Dubai standards. special weekend stay of AED 333 without breakfast. Right next to Dubai Convention Hall and Trade Center. No shops nearby. Check in and Chek out was smooth. Normal check out is 12 noon but they were kind enough to extend check out at 2 pm. If you have a car, parking could be a problem as the space is very less. U might have to use the paid parking ( about AED 5 per hour ). Free in the night till 6 am but confirm anyway at the parking. Rooms are small, clean. Bathroom is small. No tub. Novotel hotel is right behind the hotel just a door away. No pool here at the Ibis but can use the pool of Novotel for AED 20 or AED 25. There is nice Jazzbar at the Novotel. Located at the Downtown sheikh zayed rd. The opposite side of the main road is lively with decent restaurants, holiday inn, fairmont etc. Dubai is very safe any time day and night."

We thought the rooms were very clean and it was nice to have two bathrooms............ yes, the bathrooms were small but the overall design allows you to move around quite well. I like the contempory design and the flat screen TV'S were a plus (Tv's could use a little update-pic &amp; sound not to good) The only real down fall was PARKING!!! The hotel has no parking so you have to walk about 3 blocks from the 24hr parking garage. We would definitley stay here again! Location is great to restaurants, Broadway shows, shop and cocktail lounges."

We paid $120 a night for what we were told was a very nice, large room. The room was smaller than any hotel room I'd ever seen. The carpets were gross, there was NO parking (and I had been guaranteed parking when I called as I knew we were arriving at midnight on a Friday). After 7 hours of driving and just wanting to get settled, I arrived and was told I had to drive around crowded city streets and try to find an open lot with space. I never saw any sort of breakfast. We ended up cancelling the rest of the nights and went to the Holiday Inn. It was the same price for a very nice exective room in a clean hotel with concierge, an indoor pool, gym, sauna, parking and city views. I can't believe the Quartier Latin was charging as much."

The lobby is VERY tacky looking. The room we stayed in was appaulingly small. The bathroom is so small that you literally had to hang your feet into the bathtub to use the washroom. They also have no parking and no parking recommendations for you. For 3 nights we ended up having to pay $51 for parking. The hotel restaurant is Japanese only so if your not into that, then your screwed. Overall, I found the whole experience terrible, the staff not friendly at all and even though everything appeared clean, it felt very dirty."

I loved the location, close enough to walk downtown but away from all the traffic etc. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, a Starbucks, a Walgreens and a Jewel Osco within a block or so though the hotel itself is in a residential area. We were visiting a son the next street over and it was quite convenient (though the bars do let out at 4:00 am a half a block away). Our room was comfortable and quiet though rather small. The only problem we had was with the parking. Due to some unforseen circumstances, we had 2 cars in hotel parking some of the 2 nights we were there. Our parking bill was $108, as much almost as the hotel. I was charged $32 more beyond the daily charge even though my car was only in parking less than 24 hours. Parking in Chicago is expensive, yes, but shouldn't be that expensive."

The subway is 2 blocks to the south or 3 blocks to the north. The theater district is an easy 5 minute walk as is 5th avenue. Assuming you can get a decent rate, this small hotel with a lot of history seems to be a consistently clean and well valued locale. The staff is graciously efficient, and wants to please. You can go on Edson Parking website and get a discount card for the parking if you want. I would unhesitatingly recommend the Algonquin especially if you get it under 200/night."

I definitely agree with the parking, as we had a Pontiac Monte Carlo which was a mid-size sedan, and even that was a tight fit! But the room was really clean and nice, and the bathroom was quite big! The location was great, as it was a 5 minute walk to the bus that took us to the SBC Stadium area, from which point we were able to grab the MUNI up Embarcadero to catch our ferry out to Alcatraz. This was also a great deal! We happened to be there during the Oracle conference, in which EVERY room in San Fran was booked...except 1 at Nob Hill Motor Inn..and while other hotels were charging $500/night, we only paid $135/night with free parking! (The free parking was a great perk!) I would definitely recommend this hotel.. it is much nicer than its title &quot;motor inn&quot; may infer!"

Great place for coffee and breakfast. My only complaint is the $48 a day parking. Ouch! There is a much more reasonable parking garage down the street if you do not want to pay this exorbitant price.

We walked to the Mag. mile, the loop, all over...and the parking is free, your car is right there, if you need something from your car, you do not need to find it in a parking garage. Only negative we had, it is noisy at night, you hear everything going on outside, but the bed was comfortable, and we did get enough sleep. Will stay there again.

The outside looks of the hotel and the rooms themselves are not ultra-luxurious, so if you look for luxury you may need to go somewhere else (and pay considerably more). For us, however, it was the perfect choice and the &quot;petite dejeuner&quot; (continental breakfast) sufficient for a good start in the morning. Parking was also easily found around the hotel (we parked on a Friday evening and there is free parking then available all around the hotel till Monday morning).

It reminded me of one of those dowdy hotels you see around train stations in London. Fortunately, the room was commensurately priced so I feel I got what I paid for, nothing more, nothing less. The one outrageous price was hotel parking. C$30/day! The only time where I remember paying more is at the Time-Warner building in NYC. If you stay at this RC because it is a good value, do not blow your savings on hotel parking. There are lots of parking garages in the neighborhood that are probably a lot cheaper."

For this reason, we wouldn't choose this Ibis again. The only other thing was the fire alarm going off at 3 in the morning. Not the best night's sleep! Bed comfortable and good breakfast though!"

I wanted to stay in a suite at one of the more smaller hotels (boutique) or even the Omni. The room was small and the bay view was very limited. Also, although we had reservations, when we arrived we only had a choice of the second floor or the 8th floor, which was the smoking floor. The hotel's lobby is huge and beautiful, but they truly did not splurge on the rooms. The reception stated that the hotel caters to conventions and that is exactly what it felt like. The BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT, however was the hefty valet parking (there is no self parking). Parking per night was $41.00 plus a tax, which ended up being almost $50.00. For a three night stay it cost us $147.00 total for parking alone. My next stay will NOT be at the Hyatt Regency with all of the other hotels available."

There is also a mall along Harlem Ave, about 5-10 minutes drive. Hotel pool was clean but there were a lot of noisy guests using it during our stay. Breakfast is okay, bagels, cereals, sausage, fruits, waffles etc. There are ample of free parking spaces above ground and in the basement. Problem with basement parking is you need to drive out the highway to other side of hotel to access entrace. Basement parking is very tight but car seems more secure because it has garage doors.

Anyways, my stay in the suite at the end of the 13rd floor hallway was memorable. It was nicely furnished and distributed, the view on the city and the mountain was gorgeous. The foie gras from the room service was delicious, I had it twice. Got wrongly charged two nights of parking after checking-out, but staff at the accounting dept. refunded my credit card quickly. Careful with the parking charges, it is the second time I have problem with that."

After a wonderful day &amp; evening in Chicago, my husband &amp; I were very unpleasantly surprised to find out upon checking out the following morning that the parking fee for one overnight at InterContinental Chicago was $49! Yes, this hotel is right on Michigan Avenue, and yes it was a nice room, but $49 for one overnight of parking seemed inordinately high. The usual $35 parking per night in Chicago is high enough, but $49 was over the top; we will not be staying at the InterContinental again! (We booked our room through HotWire, which does not give you the parking fee costs before you book, so we'll also be very leery of using HotWire again."

The lighting in the room was not bright enough if you intend to read a book, as I did. The layout of the room was different than what I am used to, with the TV at 45 degree angle from the bed. After sitting on the bed to watch TV for 15 minutes, my neck was very sore. I used Priceline and paid $175 plus tax for one night. So maybe I got what I paid for, a standard room with no view and nothing extra. There is a parking garage directly across street from the hotel so it is convenient for those who want to save a few bucks on parking. We used the hotel valet parking ($42 + tax + tips) and was happy with it. We did have a good time shopping and dining nearby as the hotel is in easy walking distance to Union Square. All and all it was a nice stay but nothing spectacular."

I loved the location, close enough to walk downtown but away from all the traffic etc. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, a Starbucks, a Walgreens and a Jewel Osco within a block or so though the hotel itself is in a residential area. We were visiting a son the next street over and it was quite convenient (though the bars do let out at 4:00 am a half a block away). Our room was comfortable and quiet though rather small. The only problem we had was with the parking. Due to some unforseen circumstances, we had 2 cars in hotel parking some of the 2 nights we were there. Our parking bill was $108, as much almost as the hotel. I was charged $32 more beyond the daily charge even though my car was only in parking less than 24 hours. Parking in Chicago is expensive, yes, but shouldn't be that expensive."

The price for parking, however, was outrageous. It cost us more to park ($39.00 plus tax) than we paid for our rental car. The cost for parking whether you used valet or parked the car yourself was the same. When we complained on the way out to a member of the staff, his response was that in New York City it is way more, but we were not in New York City.

Had a corner studio and had plenty of room for hubby and 2 kids. Ask for a corner room they are a little bigger and have 2 views. ; ) From the time we got there the bellman &amp; front desk clerks were friendly and very helpful. Since the parking is a little pricey. The bellman told us about a parking structure around the corner for $16. The only thing you pay everytime you come in and out. However it really was not a problem because we stayed out most of the day and if we needed to come back we parked at the meter. Ended up paying about $44 all together for parking for 2 nights. Beats paying $88 anyday. Other than the parking which is pricey anywhere you stay downtown. Great stay!!!!!!"

Warm welcome, large and comfortable room. We had a 2-double-bed bedroom facing the backyard with standard bathroom. The size of the bathroom is the only downside I've found. Very small! However, plenty of hot water (showerhead was not working very effectively...) and very clean bathroom and towels. The morning receptionist (I forgot to ask him his name, but I thank him again) was very nice and accepted to keep our car in the hotel parking until 3:00 p.m. at no charge. This allowed us to go shopping on St. Denis Street without being forced to find a pay parking or to run to a parking meter every 2 hours. Greatly appreciated!"

The location of the hotel is great. It was easy to take buses and cable cars from this hotel. The cable car stop was a short walk to Union Square. Plenty of places to eat near this hotel also. Mel's Diner is on the next corner. Room service was perfect. The food was delicious and hot. Everything we ordered from room service was delivered within 15 minutes. The parking garage was great too. Our kids had bikes for the parks and bridge which were stored in our auto. Everything in out truck was perfectly safe because the parking garage is manned by Palomar employees. I have never been in a nicer parking garage. All employees were very nice and extrememly helpful. Our room was spotless and a great size. I would stay at this hotel anytime I am in San Fran and would recommend it to anyone."

We got the regular room with two twin beds and it was perfect! This room cost about $70 a night along with $20 a day parking garage fees. Being that it was next to the China town gate (the fire escape litterally has you looking straight down to it) and walking distance to Union Square and all public transportation, this was a great price! Dont forget to ask about the $20 parking because if you dont you will pay up to $35 a day for parking....the hotel and parking garage have a contract together. There is not very good Wi-Fi in the hotel but there are tons of places nearby that offer it for free like the starbucks across the way and a nearby borders. It wasnt a fancy hotel but offered bare essentials. San Fran is a big city so expect nose whereever you stay."

The room was very nice, on the top floor with a great view of the city and the Golden Gate bridge. The location is a strong point, within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf and the cable car lines. The only problem is the parking situation. The garage is small for the hotel size, individual parking spaces are small as well, and there's a $20 per day parking fee. If you're picking up or returning a rental car in SF, think about whether you really need to have it during your stay here - it may not be worth the expense and hassle."

Unfriendly staff, not a pleasant experience. Room looked out onto an abandoned gravel lot with garbage in it. Parking was not mentioned to be a fee when booked. Couldn't park on the street (all restricted areas). Was initially told that parking was around the corner and in thru the wire fence. Couldn't locate parking so asked again to different person. Was then told parking was $15 and not provided by the hotel. Small unsecured lot. I was hoping that my car would still be there in the morning!!! Did not get accomodations I had made a reservation for. Reserved a king, got a queen. Shower curtain was tied back with a piece of toilet paper. Old mini-bar hidden in tv cabinet. Breakfast consisted of Croissants, juice and coffee. Better than nothing. Will never stay at an Econolodge again if this is what to expect."

This is what we got for 48$us per night: King bed,mini fridge,coffee maker, fog horn noise from the Golden gate bridge, tight space or non-existent parking, and ghetto-like room neighbors. If you think about using the pool, DON'T. They should think about burrying it and putting more parking space over it. It was very dirty. The room was clean but had a strong smell of carpet deodorant floating around, but we vented it out quickly by opening the window. This is a good hotel for the budget-oriented traveller because of the cheap rates and because it is located in a good neighborhood (Cow's Hollow). You could access everything by using public transit, but much easier with a car.. Bring lots of quarters for metered parking when you visit the city!!!"

We had two rooms and were moved and upgraded so we could have adjoining rooms at no extra charge, which was great. It is on the snobbier, hipper side of things, which was a bit much, but the bar scene was fun and it was nice not having to leave to go to a SF hotspot. I guess this hotel is not for anyone, but we had a nice enough time. Extra note. Ditch the high priced room service and hit up the Starbucks across the street!Also, parking is WAY overpriced. There is another parking structure a few blocks away if you are horrified about spending $45!!! for valet a night!!!! That price makes the room rate less appealing!!!! The parking structure is still crazy (I guess Union Square parking is a nightmare) but it will still save you a bit..."

There were far too few handicapped spaces and virtually NO spaces of any kind if we got back after 10 PM. I would have to let her out and make her stand there by the door until I parked wqay in the back and came back to help her to our room. What is worse is that they are expanding.

The fee to park was outrageous; $37 per night + 14% tax. Two nights of parking cost $84.00 plus valet tips each time you take the car out. This was painful.

The staff were friendly and the rooms were comfortable and well furnished. The hotel seemed very quiet on the weekend, which was ideal for us. The room service we ordered one evening was very tasty. We had a problem with a noisy air-conditioner, but we moved (and upgraded) to another room with no fuss. Through no fault of the hotel, we were caught out with an unexpectedly high parking charge using the 'City of London' parking at London Wall. Saturday morning is not considered off peak and the parking costs went from 3 pounds per day for the rest of the bank holiday and weekend to 3 pounds per hour between 06:00 and 13:00 on the Saturday."

The hotel is nice, the suites are roomy enough for families, and the huge bathrooms are fantastic. The location is good if you are planning on taking the train into town for everything you do (it is right next to Cumberland Station), as long as you do not mind a 30-minute train ride. I knew the parking was $20 a night, but I read some reviews online that said you could avoid it by parking in free lots around the hotel. But there aren't free lots around the hotel -- every lot has a sign saying that if you do not have a permit, you'll get towed. I did not want to take the risk, so I parked in the hotel garage. Lovely hotel, but $20 per night parking is overpriced for the location. Also, no free wifi in the rooms. That was kind of surprising."

Every person we dealt with at the hotel couldn't have been nicer, our room was immaculate and simple. A perfect combination of Japanese and Western design, very comfortable and pleasant. The greatest was the parking. The hotel charges a modest $20.00 per night parking fee, a bargain in San Francisco. If their small parking lot is full as it was one night they send you to the public parking lot aroung the corner and reminburse the parking fee. They have a small restaurant in the hotel, we only had breakfast there but it was very good. The Tomo is now our go to place when visiting San Francisco."

Valet parking was $51, ramp parking $36. Location was very nice &amp; walking distance to museums &amp; miracle mile. Hotel bar was cool but service a bit slow. Concierge helpful on Fri but nobody on Sat Valentines day at 7:30. Sunday check out was tedious, waited over 20 minutes for elevator! Probably was the floor we on. Valet parking took 10+ minutes but not horrible. Would stay again at this price any time!"

The 1 bedroom suite was bigger than many apartments with full-sized kitchen (stove, microwave, dishwasher, utensils and pots with deposit etc.). The staff was friendly and the room was very clean. We backed onto the courtyard so the view was rather boring. The hotel was difficult to find and we drove right passed it on the first run. Valet parking was really the only option since many streets have signs forbidding overnight parking (and apparently the neighbourhood is not the best). Would stay again if the rates were similar ($99 CAD off season) although i might try to find a place where the parking was not so costly ($14/night)."

Got a great rate - $32, plus another $3 for parking. I was afraid that my flight might be canceled, so I would be out $32 at worst. My stay was without incident, but be more alert while going from the parking garage to the lobby. It feels a tad more deserted at 2 a.m. compared to a Strip parking deck. This is a great place to stay if you want a room at a really inexpensive rate, especially on weekdays. The Good:- Friendly desk staff- Decent sized room- Great rateThe Bad:- Smoky casino, but it is downtown Las Vegas- Some noise from Fremont Street if your room oversees Fremont. - Parking is $3 a day."

It is in an old building so the rooms have that kind of old Europe size and character. Nice and clean, we enjoyed our 2 night stay. The rate was excellent, and we were centrally located to downtown so dining and tourist fun was all within walking distance. Short drive out to Olympic area. The only negative is parking. Parking is not included and they only have a few spaces. Parking in nearby lots and on the street is manageable but inconvenient. I slept a few minutes late and got a parking ticket. There is a go-go bar nearby but the neighborhood is safe and friendly with nice shops and excellent restaurants."

For $96/night we got a spacious suite with living room, bedroom, kitchenette, bathroom with tub, and balcony. It also included high-speed internet (wired), breakfast, and parking. It was clean, relatively comfortable, and the service was fine. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to stay close to the village. It's an easy 5 minute walk. It's also an easy 10 minute walk to the old town. Just be aware that the parking lot is off-site. It's across the street and the parking garage is very small and scary. I did not mind, but I wouldn't recommend women traveling alone to use the garage."

I did not eat at the hotel, but I did see some of the food being served as I checked in, and I have to say it did look very nice. Parking could be an issue if you arrive after 20.30. The hotel's website says there are a small number of parking spaces at the hotel and a 24 hour park car nearby. I arrived at 21.30 to find the hotel car park full, (fair enough), but the nearby Kings Mall car park is locked for entry at 20.30, which leaves you the choice of paying to park at an unsupervised car park in the centre of Hammersmith, or parking on the road outside the hotel for free, (as long as you remember to move the car before 07.00 when the parking restrictions start). Overall the stay was fine, but I won't turn up at the hotel late with a car again."

The room was clean, beds were comfy, towels were plush. There was always someone helpful at the desk. We worked with the desk personnel, the doormen and the concierge; all were helpful and very quick to respond to any need. The size of the room for a midtown location was amazing; the suite is the way to go for a family. We did find cheaper parking at an icon parking garage, so we skipped the valet parking the hotel offered. The neighborhood, and the proximity to the subway station all added to the value of this hotel. All I can say is, stay here, stay here, stay here!!"

On par with other hotels. One warning I would share is that parking in the hotel is outragiously expensive (around $50-$60/day). Also, the staff working at the budget rental car desk located in the hotel were extraordinarily unhelpful (bordering on rude) and they close in early afternoon on weekends forcing you to effectively pay for overnight parking in the hotel (unless you can find street parking) which, as noted above, is extremely expensive."

Bonus, there is a cable car stop right outside.. really easy to get to Pier 39, Alcatraz, Fisherman's Wharf, The Cannery, etc. There is a nice restaurant in the hotel as well as nearby. The hotel is situated very close to union sq... an almost perfect location... without paying the big bucks... it is in fact a better location than many of the big names.. but you wont be paying as much. However, we did get a VERY small room... and a tiny bathroom.. Overall, very happy campers!"

All the staff are very friendly and helpful, as are the valet service members. Parking the car can be a problem as the hotel is located on the main road Rene Levesque and parking for the car to arrange the valet to park the car can at times be difficult, particularly during the period 1600 - 1700 hrs due to parking inspectors on the prowl. The room was of a very good standard, which contained a small kitchenette consisting of a medium sized fridge, microwave, sink etc. The bed was firm and comfortable and the bathroom of a decent size, with the water pressure being very good. The hotel is located near Chinatown, a 5 min walk and downtown a 10-15 min walk, depending on where you are heading."

And we had a nice babysitter one evening. Breakfast was also nice in the mornings. But . . . there is no elevator (lift), and the reception desk staff had no useful knowledge regarding parking in the area (we arrived by car). There is no reasonably priced parking nearby, so we parked in a lot almost a mile away. There is also no loading zone in front of the hotel. So we were socked with a 50 pound parking ticket followed by a 65 pound clamping (over $200 american) while I was getting our daughter ready to leave and my husband was loading the car. The reception desk staff was completely unsympathetic, and a follow-up call to the proprietor yielded the same indifference. That leads me to think that they were just happy to get our money for the room and had no real feeling of responsibility for the happiness of their guests!"

Parking was very tight in the garage and they say parking is $25 but they also charge a $3.50 parking tax upon check out. Room was nice, beds were lumpy and pillows were rock hard. We paid for a bay view, and that was very nice; had a view of the Golden Gate Bridge!! Free breakfast does not start until 6:30 am so if you have an early flight, forget about breakfast.

While centrally located with an excellent view, as a priceline hotel this location makes no sense. You might GET the hotel room for 60 bucks a night, but the price for parking, FOR GUESTS, is an unheard of 55 dollars a night including tax. Moreover, internet service is both spotty AND expensive as their wifi will run you $9.99 a day. Overall, for one night, it is fine. Not great but fine. But if you DO go. Park across the street at the Embarcadero parking structure. There, the price is only 25 dollars a day for parking. Granted, there's a lovely lobby and it is located right by the cable cars. But there are plenty of VERY NICE three star hotels with free wifi and FREE parking. If you get this hotel on Priceline, good luck to you."

The morning continental breakfast was wonderful and again served in the sitting room. The location was great for getting around San Francisco. We could hear the cable car bell clanging from our room.

We were just a block or two off the strip - in a prime location - right in the middle. We rented a car at the airport so we could do some side trips, so we did not actually walk to the strip. Most of the hotels have free parking, so we did not incur any additional parking costs. Our condo was fabulous behind gates with a guard, and underground parking with a remote for the gates. The condo was totally redone with travertine floors, granite in the kitchen as well as stainless appliances, modern furnishings and very comfortable beds. With three TV's, there was plenty of opportunties for different TV shows and quiet naps at the same time. We never got a chance to spend time at the pool, but it was lovely. We will definately stay here again - it was fabulous, and away from the madness of the strip."

When I arrived, I was told the parking was $13 per night; when I got the bill, the price had changed to $39 a night WITH a $5.00 & quot;parking tax.&quot ; I had to pay $44 for parking when the lot right across the street was charging $28 a day. This hotel and its staff are second rate. Do yourself a favor and book a room somewhere else. After this experience I think sleeping next to the homless guy in the cardboard box on Pier 39 would be better than the Sheraton in San Francisco at Fisherman's Wharf."

Only negative is that the breakfast area is quite small considering the size of the hotel. We choose not to stand-in line to wait for food and what appeared to be a wait for a table. There is a Corner Bakery just a couple of blocks away that was very good and very reasonably priced. We chose to self-park rather than pay for valet parking.

Very clean, nice interior design, inexpensive. Free computer and internet in every room! Okay free continental breakfast. The room is nice but not quite spacious, which I guess is okay for a downtown hotel. Parking is $17, but you can find cheaper parking closeby.

When you book there is a little disclaimer that some hotels charge for parking. In San Fransisco this is kind of common. But this motle had absolutely no parking at all. We arrived late around 6:30 and were told to park on the street (but not to leave anything in our car or it would be broken into.) We drove around and around for quite sometime and found nothing! We finally ended up parking in a garage 3 blocks away. We were told it would cost $9 but when we returned to pick up our car the next morning we were actually charged $15! This is quite a bit aoncsidering we only paid $50 for the room. Also, the room was right on Lombard St ans EXTREMELY noisy. And to make matters worse, there was no A/C so we had to open the windows. It was Jan but so incredible hot due to the radiator which we could not adjust. Room was small but clean and there was a decent breakfast."

The staff was barely tolerable, the walls were paper thin and the rooms seemed a bit run down. The parking charge at $28 per day was, to me, the icing on the cake. The Raddison (where friends stayed) was more expensive per night but they came out nearly the same when you factored in parking. It was not the worst. It was clean and tolerable but if you're going on vacation spend a couple extra dollars and upgrade. Also, if you do stay be sure to request a 2nd floor room. The noise on the first floor from the parking lot and other guests was bad."

The self-parking is about 1 block away and is underground/indoor. The gym facilities was one of the best gym facilities that I've seen in a hotel (but I generally stay at lower class hotels). I got overcharged in my minibar tab but hotel staff fixed it when I mentioned the items that I had used (I was charged for a bottle of water which I did not use when I only used/had 2 bottles of alcohol). Wireless Internet was very stable/good and no problems connecting from my room. For the price I paid, it was a nice hotel.

The hotel was great, much nicer than the hotel we stayed at the previous year (Grand HYatt). The rooms were large with great amenities and the staff was very courteous. The breakfast buffet was an added bonus as the food was good and hot and they had great coffee. What made the stay a bit of a disappointment was we had to pay $55 a day for parking, the only parking available at the hotel is Valet Parking. I am not upset about the $55 a day parking, I expected it in NYC. What I am upset about is that we had a radar detector stolen out of our car. It was hidden in the glove compartment and the only people who had contact with our car while we were in NYC was the Valet parking staff. I do feel that for the cost of the parking, we should not have to worry about stuff being stolen out of our car."

The room just looks really crappy. The ceiling looks like it has a lot of molds and cracked paint. T.V. was not even plugged and you would have to push a huge table to plug it in. Bed sheets looked and felt &quot;dirty&quot;, which was really disgusting. Limited parking and plus we had to pay.

Since I could hardly afford the other high ranked hotels in Montreal I tried Le Square Phillips Hotel &amp; Suites and I could hardly imagine a much better experience. Though they have valet parking (I hate valet parkinging... I like to have easy access to my car at all times)... the hotel is located right next to a huge outdoor parking lot where I was able to see my car everytime I walked out of the hotel (yes!) The rooms were large with a fully equipped kitchen. And the location was perfect for us...walking distance to great department stores... Old Montreal, China Town, Place De Arts, Museums...and it is tucked away on a lightly traveled side street. Even my Montreal-resident friend was unaware that this hotel existed. My only quibble... the foam rubber pillows are horrible. Next time I'll bring my own. And there will be a next time. Until I can afford $700 a night this will be my choice hotel in Montreal."

There are parking zones in front of the hotel that shares the block with two other hotels and a laundromat. At times there were a number of patrons in the street using the few parking spots. Inside the hotel itself the walls are rather thin making it quite noisy later in the evening and early in the morning. The hotel staff seemed aloof and the management was sparcely available. I highly recommend spending $30 eleswhere in Union Square that has parking and cleaner rooms."

And, unlike some places I've stayed, it is $41 for the day, not $41 each time you put the car in. (Of course, check their site, fees change.)The hotel location is great, right on the wharf, the lobby was spotless, as was the room. The valet parking, while expensive by Madison (WI) standards, was very nice during the day, we did not have to wait to drop off or retrieve the car. The downside? The service. The check-in clerk was disinterested, at best. On check-out, the clerk was downright rude. They also refused to discount or refund the final &quot;day&quot; of parking, despite our departure at 4AM. On top of it, the valet was not on duty, so I was given the keys and sent to the garage to find the car. So, stay, if you're not driving, or if you've carefully compared other accommodations, including parking."

The room was very nice, on the top floor with a great view of the city and the Golden Gate bridge. The location is a strong point, within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf and the cable car lines. The only problem is the parking situation. The garage is small for the hotel size, individual parking spaces are small as well, and there's a $20 per day parking fee. If you're picking up or returning a rental car in SF, think about whether you really need to have it during your stay here - it may not be worth the expense and hassle."

Le Roberval is a 2.5 star hotel and is much nicer than most other hotels with that rating. For $96/night we got a spacious suite with living room, bedroom, kitchenette, bathroom with tub, and balcony. It also included high-speed internet (wired), breakfast, and parking. It was clean, relatively comfortable, and the service was fine. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to stay close to the village. It's an easy 5 minute walk. It's also an easy 10 minute walk to the old town. Just be aware that the parking lot is off-site. It's across the street and the parking garage is very small and scary. I did not mind, but I wouldn't recommend women traveling alone to use the garage."

Since I could hardly afford the other high ranked hotels in Montreal I tried Le Square Phillips Hotel &amp; Suites and I could hardly imagine a much better experience. Though they have valet parking (I hate valet parkinging... I like to have easy access to my car at all times)... the hotel is located right next to a huge outdoor parking lot where I was able to see my car everytime I walked out of the hotel (yes!) The rooms were large with a fully equipped kitchen. And the location was perfect for us...walking distance to great department stores... Old Montreal, China Town, Place De Arts, Museums...and it is tucked away on a lightly traveled side street. Even my Montreal-resident friend was unaware that this hotel existed. My only quibble... the foam rubber pillows are horrible. Next time I'll bring my own. And there will be a next time. Until I can afford $700 a night this will be my choice hotel in Montreal."

We too were warned about the lack of parking spaces and the ominous threat of tickets so with a rental car, we were a little dubious. The Francisco Bay Inn is exactly what the reviews say. Smaller, independently run, spotlessly clean and close to many SF attractions. We noticed the traffic noise too but were able to block it all out by simply closing the window. There was a small fridge and microwave, a charming retro elevator, creative parking and extremely polite staff. The breakfast was an afterthought so you should know that going in. We stayed 3 nights (booked online) in mid-September and would definitely go back again. Compared to the other chain hotel rates starting at around $160 (sometimes not incl. parking) , this place was a steal at $99 for the weeknights and only slightly higher on the weekend."

I definitely agree with the parking, as we had a Pontiac Monte Carlo which was a mid-size sedan, and even that was a tight fit! But the room was really clean and nice, and the bathroom was quite big! The location was great, as it was a 5 minute walk to the bus that took us to the SBC Stadium area, from which point we were able to grab the MUNI up Embarcadero to catch our ferry out to Alcatraz. This was also a great deal! We happened to be there during the Oracle conference, in which EVERY room in San Fran was booked...except 1 at Nob Hill Motor Inn..and while other hotels were charging $500/night, we only paid $135/night with free parking! (The free parking was a great perk!) I would definitely recommend this hotel.. it is much nicer than its title &quot;motor inn&quot; may infer!"

The motel is located on Lombard Street, just 6 blocks away from the crooked part. You can walk to Fisherman's Wharf in about :15. Of the many positives, I would have to say that their BEST attraction is that they offer free parking to overnight guests. The majority of the hotels and motels we researched charged anywhere from $15-$30 a night just to park your car in their parking lot! With parking in San Francisco being difficult to find, we felt this was an amazing plus. There are two great shopping districts within walking distance. One to the west of the motel and the other to the east. The area is not ritzy and has a ton of motels, but if you're looking for low price with cleanliness this is your place. Also, the customer service was outstanding and the housekeepers did an EXCELLENT job at keeping our room extremely clean."

To find out his parking lot was full (which by the way was $21 a night) but said with a smile that there is parking around the corner which is $16...to which he said he would have parked my car again still at $21. I found parking 2 blocks down which was $10 for 24 hours. Not very safe out there at night but then again no where in San Francisco is safe at night. But there is an array of bright lights stating there is a sex shop right in front. Not very pleasing. The room is so small and dusty. BUT i did have a working clock but the alarm did not work but at least it showed the time. Hey if your in for a budget... can't complain. But to be honest I would rather stay in a motel 6 outside of San Francisco than there. The hotel is kind of freaky."

There was no notice at check-in, nothing in the key packet explaining the benefits nor anything on the spg.com website. Going back, I do see a small line item in the taxes on the reservation, but this is sneaky and gives Starwood a bad name. But even more pathetic is that this hotel, which is surrounded by power lines and parking lots dares to call itself a &quot;resort&quot;. They say it is to cover bottled water, valet parking, pool use, gym, etc. But water is given to SPG members in the past , parking had always been complementary and so is use of the small, concrete lined pool. If there was real value to the &quot;resort fee&quot; and better disclosure I would not be so upset, but this is a bad move all around for Starwood and the management of the Westin Casurina. Shame on them!"

The self-parking is about 1 block away and is underground/indoor. The gym facilities was one of the best gym facilities that I've seen in a hotel (but I generally stay at lower class hotels). I got overcharged in my minibar tab but hotel staff fixed it when I mentioned the items that I had used (I was charged for a bottle of water which I did not use when I only used/had 2 bottles of alcohol). Wireless Internet was very stable/good and no problems connecting from my room. For the price I paid, it was a nice hotel. However, I would not pay their standard rate of over $150/night since it is expensive for the items that I use."

The room was clean, beds were comfy, towels were plush. There was always someone helpful at the desk. We worked with the desk personnel, the doormen and the concierge; all were helpful and very quick to respond to any need. The size of the room for a midtown location was amazing; the suite is the way to go for a family. We did find cheaper parking at an icon parking garage, so we skipped the valet parking the hotel offered. The neighborhood, and the proximity to the subway station all added to the value of this hotel. All I can say is, stay here, stay here, stay here!!"

The beds were super comfortable, and the staff was very helpful recommending a restaurant within walking distance. We parked our rented mini-van in an enclosed garage 2 blocks away. Parking validation from the front desk got us a reduced parking rate. During the day the neighborhood was colorful - flower vendors everywhere. But at night we were a little nervous. The flower vendors are gone and there are no open restaurants or businesses or anything on the hotel's block. It appears things are being rehabbed all around so I imagine the barren block will change over time, which will probably drive up the room price. At just under $200 we were very pleased. Taxicabs were easy to get right in front of the hotel."

The lighting in the room was not bright enough if you intend to read a book, as I did. The layout of the room was different than what I am used to, with the TV at 45 degree angle from the bed. After sitting on the bed to watch TV for 15 minutes, my neck was very sore. I used Priceline and paid $175 plus tax for one night. So maybe I got what I paid for, a standard room with no view and nothing extra. There is a parking garage directly across street from the hotel so it is convenient for those who want to save a few bucks on parking. We used the hotel valet parking ($42 + tax + tips) and was happy with it. We did have a good time shopping and dining nearby as the hotel is in easy walking distance to Union Square. All and all it was a nice stay but nothing spectacular."

I have stayed in four other motels in SF. This was by far the most reasonable cost wise and better quality that some. It was clean, comfortable, and safe. Cheaper parking than most places. It is a bit of a walk from the wharf, farther than I thought. But they do have the bus that will take you within a block of the motel. Breakfast was a typical continental breakfast, but not great. Staff very friendly and helpful. No computers for guest to use, although the rooms have internet connection available. I did not have a room with a view, but was only staying one night and wanted to watch my costs. The parking is located under the motel and is a tight fit, but better than parking on the street or paying an exorbatant rate."

Yes,it is old, and outdated inside, but it is clean, and the rooms are spacious. The location is walking distance to EVERYTHING!!!! We went for the weekend to see the &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; and could even walk to the theatre. We walked to the Mag. mile, the loop, all over...and the parking is free, your car is right there, if you need something from your car, you do not need to find it in a parking garage. Only negative we had, it is noisy at night, you hear everything going on outside, but the bed was comfortable, and we did get enough sleep. Will stay there again. The hotel across the street was double the price. Try it, it is worth it, if you plan on seeing Chicago, and justwant to sleep and shower!!!!!!!"

It is close to Fisherman's Wharf and within walking distance of public transportation, dining, China Town, shopping, grocery and downtown. Most other hotels charge extra for parking, anywhere from $20 to 50 a day. Rooms are average but clean and housekeeping does a good job. Front office staff in general is helpful. Opening the window does bring in the street noise. Pat's cafe is good but the Indian restaurant across the street is noisy and has average food with poor service. You can request a refrigerator for $5/day but there is no microwave. Considering Trader Joe's and Safeway are only a couple of blocks away, microwave would be really useful."

Smallish rooms on busy Lombard Street does provide some noise. If that is a problem for you, then look somewhere else. It was not for us, we are hard sleepers. The only real problem with this place is huge! There is No place to park. There are a few street parking spots available, but they are never available! We had to go park in a parking structure about 3 or 4 blocks away for $20 a day! So any money we saved by finding this place, we paid even more after paying for parking. I would recommend this place if you have no car to park, because it is a good value for this pricey city. But, if you have a car, please do not waste your time.

Swimming and fitness area access was weird had to go through a massage rmt section to get to poolI did have a massage there very good therapists however working space very cramped. Parking is about 22.00 canadain a day for valet. I recommand this parking for people who have never driven in montreal and the parking lot is huge. Also with the directions given I got lost have not been to montreal in 20 years I leave it up to old age ask hotel for directions they could not help. Swimming pool hot tub and fitness area very nice best I seen in my travels."

Parking is limited but its FREE! try to come early to get the free parking because its first come first serve! This hotel probably gave me the most out of my buck. Rates are budgeted around $50-$90... and the rooms look like their newly remodeled..which included a microwave, refridgerator, and a little cofee maker... their rooms start on the second floor, first floor is all parking... unfortunatly they have no elevators...taking the stairs were not that bad..but i would prefer an elevator anytime.... The hotel also started offering FREE HIGH SPEED INTERNET! they have not advertised that amenity anywhere on their website or even in their room which i thought was weird. But overall this hotel provides all the necessity needs of a buisness traveler."

Upon arrival at the resort the staff was very friendly and our check in was quick. We had a 2 bedroom, 1 bath on the 2nd floor of the main building #1. The bedrooms were large as well as the kitchen, dining area &amp; living room. Would had prefered 2 bathrooms but it was not a problem. This is an older resort, but clean. The resort is very convient to the &quot;strip&quot;. This resort is directly behind the Imperal Palace where you can walk through the parking lot to Las Vegas Blvd. The room was cleaned mid week with fresh towels, clean sheets &amp; they even washed the few dishes we had from breakfast. Throughout our stay all the staff was friendly &amp; helpful. The parking was easy with a parking garage as well as off street parking. We would stay there again except the resort is going to be torn down for a city complex. Summer Bay Resorts is moving..."

The &quot;valet&quot; parking is really the parking garage on the corner. The hotel stamps your parking ticket and you will get a discounted rate so it only costs $30 a day (per 24-hour period) to park. (This is as cheap as you can get here!!)Nice hotel."

On arrival it became clear that parking wasnt included. I was advised that I could park in their carpark at a cost of 12- but unfortunatly there were not any spaces available. The rooms were clean and spacious, with a standard buffet style breakfast. Ive also stayed at the Express near the MIllenium Dome, which I would recomed over this one. Free parking for a start!I probably wont book with Express again though - they've put their prices up recenty. Some of them by an additional 50 per night. Used to be a good hotel chain offering good value for money, a touch up the range from Premier Travel Inn. However..You can now stay at a Hilton Hotel for the same price!"

Overall, I found it to be good value, but there were a couple of concerns:1. I had bought the valet parking package. The check in time starts at 3pm and I arrived at about 3:40pm. The waiting area for valet parking is an area where there is no standing allowed between 4pm-6pm. I was a solo traveler and it was a struggle to try to check in and watch the car in the 30 minute wait for the one valet parking person to get to my car, with the fear of being towed.2. It's a only a 5 minute walk to Union Square, but it is in a borderline neighborhood (massage parlors, etc.), and I would not recommend it for nervous or inexperienced travelers. Overall, I would stay here again and recommend it to seasoned, budget minded travelers."

We had a problem with the safe, they fixed in 2 minutes (seriously); had a problem with TV, fixed in 3 minutes. Also we booked parking under the hotel for $16 a night. On Saturday night we took our car to go to Old Town. When we came back at 2 am, parking was full. Front desk helped us to find a free parking outside of the hotel and reimbursed us for the whole 24 hours. Fast and very helpful. As another people mentioned, bottles of water and mini bar is touch sensitive. They will charge you if you will move bottles or open mini bar. On your check in they will tell you this right away. In case if you accidently move bottles you should call them right away. Love Montreal, cant wait to come back."

The location was not bad, really accessible to Pier 39, The Embarcadero and North Beach. The HDTV was nice and the room was nice. But that was not enough to make our stay any pleasant at all. The minute we got there and was informed that the daily parking was $43 plus tax. Turned out to be $49 a night just for parking. That was pathetic. I've never parked anywhere in san francisco where parking was over $30. This ruined everything. I do not know , it did not seem like the parking fee caused any complaints. I just wanted word out to whoever is going to make a future booking here, to be aware of the close to $50 daily parking fee. This was BS."

I was pleasantly surprised to see the size of the room to be quite large. The location of the hotel is also great, as it is a few blocks from Union Square. The one negative regarding the hotel (not just the hotel but anywhere in San Francisco) is the parking situation. I believe the valet parking is $45/night, but I found parking offsite for $20/night. The public transportation is quite good, so once I parked the car, I never took it out again until we were leaving. I would definitley stay at the Orchard again."

The room was clean except for the carpet which had some staining. The bedding was luxurious and our suite had two flat screen tvs. In the afternoon we were treated to wine and cheese in a small sitting area right outside our room. The morning continental breakfast was wonderful and again served in the sitting room. The location was great for getting around San Francisco. We could hear the cable car bell clanging from our room. We opted for the self parking which was about a block away as the valet parking was $40 a day compared to the $25 fee for self parking. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.

Actually, it is at the upper floors of a hotel/school complex. It locates at the west end of the busy district. Subway to go downtown is close by but you need to good through a tunnel (which is slightly smelly and somebody sleeps there at night). Taxi to go downtown is around $10.If you choose the signature room, it is pretty spacious with a queen and sofa beds almost at the same price. Some rooms have a pretty good view of downtown. If you book through AAA/CAA, it costs you a premium but includes parking and breakfast. Depending on the number of occupants, it may worth it. You need to register in the hotel before you can go to the building parking. However, there is no parking space in front of the hotel."

It's in a busy part of the city and there's nowhere you can park in the immediate neighborhood. Even though they appear to own the garage, (The Palace Parking Garage), they pass the cost on to you in addition to the room rate. This sort of set the tone. Once inside I found out that the pool and jacuzzi where out of service, but if I wanted to walk three city blocks to a sister hotel, I could use theirs. Walking across downtown SF in flip flops, wrapped in a towel did not appeal, so that was off the table. The rooms were fine and the lobby is beautiful, but really, at a 4 star hotel you're paying for service - like parking and a pool. I'd pass on the palace next time around."

Decent price compared to Dubai standards. special weekend stay of AED 333 without breakfast. Right next to Dubai Convention Hall and Trade Center. No shops nearby. Check in and Chek out was smooth. Normal check out is 12 noon but they were kind enough to extend check out at 2 pm. If you have a car, parking could be a problem as the space is very less. U might have to use the paid parking ( about AED 5 per hour ). Free in the night till 6 am but confirm anyway at the parking. Rooms are small, clean. Bathroom is small. No tub. Novotel hotel is right behind the hotel just a door away. No pool here at the Ibis but can use the pool of Novotel for AED 20 or AED 25. There is nice Jazzbar at the Novotel. Located at the Downtown sheikh zayed rd. The opposite side of the main road is lively with decent restaurants, holiday inn, fairmont etc. Dubai is very safe any time day and night."

We used the Myers parking garage around the block on 46th Street. The hotel will validate your parking receipt when you check out . This cuts the 24 hr parking rate from $50 to $25 dollars. This was our only problem with our stay as we were 15 minutes late getting to the garage for pick- up and were charged an extra $21 dollars. All things considered is was a real nice time had by all."

I had to park my car and get my own luggage going down the walkway to the front desk and do my check-in. There is no space in the entrance of the hotel that allow you to drop off the luggage and come back for it. Also, although I did not have any problems, the staff on the parking garage is not friendly at all. I would come back to this hotel for the good deal on their price and cleaness but will look for another parking. I notice that there are other parking in the same block and they did not not bad as this one."

Priceline would not help us, Priceline did tell me if we got another hotel we could not get any of our money back. So dont ever book anything through Priceline either. I got it 2 ways while there. Nor did Priceline tell me we would have to pay 25 dollars a day for parking on top of what we paied for that nasty room. Nor do they tell you parking is 2 and a half blocks from the hotel.

It is in an old building so the rooms have that kind of old Europe size and character. Nice and clean, we enjoyed our 2 night stay. The rate was excellent, and we were centrally located to downtown so dining and tourist fun was all within walking distance. Short drive out to Olympic area. The only negative is parking. Parking is not included and they only have a few spaces. Parking in nearby lots and on the street is manageable but inconvenient. I slept a few minutes late and got a parking ticket. There is a go-go bar nearby but the neighborhood is safe and friendly with nice shops and excellent restaurants."

The hotel I had for the next 2 days was twice as much and about the same in quality,difference was location. If I had found out about this hotel sooner I would have booked the entire stay here. Rooms were clean and normal size hotel rooms not the normal &quot;New York&quot; size hotel rooms. We had a room overlooking the pool which would be great in the summer. I just got back and stayed there on 12/9/04 and would go back for sure. Staff was nice and professional, and a big plus the free parking in a secure parking lot. Parking can cost up to $40 a night in New York and the price plus free parking, can't beat it!"

The breakfast area was nice with lots of tables, and the food selection ok. The bathroom was pretty small. Be careful of the parking garage. First, the parking fee is $26, and the parking is very tight. We had a minivan, and manauvering was very difficult. Also, there are two flights of stairs from the parking garage to the elevator in the lobby, so you will have to carry up all your luggage. You may want to consider unloading from the street out in front, before parking in the garage. Other than that, we were very happy with our stay, and with the view from out window."

This is what we got for 48$us per night: King bed,mini fridge,coffee maker, fog horn noise from the Golden gate bridge, tight space or non-existent parking, and ghetto-like room neighbors. If you think about using the pool, DON'T. They should think about burrying it and putting more parking space over it. It was very dirty. The room was clean but had a strong smell of carpet deodorant floating around, but we vented it out quickly by opening the window. This is a good hotel for the budget-oriented traveller because of the cheap rates and because it is located in a good neighborhood (Cow's Hollow). You could access everything by using public transit, but much easier with a car.. Bring lots of quarters for metered parking when you visit the city!!!"

You can't walk through the lobby from without at least two or three people saying 'hello,' 'welcome back' or 'have a nice day.' This place has by far the friendliest staff anywhere that I've stayed!The rooms are large and nice -- they are not amazing, but they are very clean and comfortable. The fridge and microwave are a nice treat, especially with the Trade Joes attached to the building, you can get, keep and heat up snacks very easily. The elevators are fast and quiet, the parking is enclosed and convenient (you can use the parking pass until 6pm the day that you check out!). The only thing that I would change is that they do not have complimentary breakfast, it is $11 p/p on weekends, so we've just gone elsewhere. Very nice hotel, extremely friendly staff and an amazing location."

I contacted the manager of the property and was told they had no control over the company that ran the parking service. The hotel was of no help in trying to resolve this problem even after my friend received a letter from the parking servive company informing her that an investigation indicated they were not at fault. I checked out of the hotel and spent the rest of my business trip(21 more days) at the Sofetel Hotel. I paid my friend $500 to have her car repaired and have not been back to the Marriott Downtown since. I have been back to the Sofetel for an additional 19 days."

The hotel was excellent---great service, very clean and quiet, and right in the middle of all the shops in San Francisco. Plenty of great places to eat nearby. The trolley to Fisherman's Wharf and other locations was a few steps away. I got the Internet package that included parking. Parking is at a premium in SF and is very expensive. Driving around SF is not a pleasant experience so park the car and leave it. Also, be prepared to tip. The hotel has a bellman, valet parking, a concierge, etc. I would definitely stay there again."

Bonus, there is a cable car stop right outside.. really easy to get to Pier 39, Alcatraz, Fisherman's Wharf, The Cannery, etc. There is a nice restaurant in the hotel as well as nearby. The hotel is situated very close to union sq... an almost perfect location... without paying the big bucks... it is in fact a better location than many of the big names.. but you wont be paying as much. However, we did get a VERY small room... and a tiny bathroom.. Overall, very happy campers!"

One small concern, the hotel staff seem a little confused weather or not to charge for parking. The hotel website states that parking is $15.00 per night.

Desk personnel eager to help including letting me come into office to print my boarding pass when they had trouble doing it.

Beautiful hotel with great service and location. We live in the suburbs and drove to the city for our stay. Parking is expensive at $34.00 per night.. that would'nt have been so bad but after leaving the hotel and driving a short distance we realized our full tank of gas had been siphoned. We called the hotel and learned that anyone can get into the parking garage...that there isnt an attendent on duty. They took some information from us but we never got the feeling that anything was going to be done as far as compensation. Beware if you park your car there."

Close to quite a bit and right on a bus line. The only negative I have is that the overnight parking rate seemed high even for Chicago. It did not help that there's a surface parking lot right across the street, but did not appear to have anyone tending it. I'd enjoy hearing if there's anyone who's tried the lot or if there's an attended lot nearby someone has used?There's a Hackney's (local Chicago favorite American food restaurant) within walking distance as well as a Potbelly sandwich place right next door. There's also a 24 hour convenience store that's well stocked (7-11) right around the corner."

We booked this hotel through hotels.com and were happy with our stay. We had initially booked a standard King room but when we got there and asked for a room with a view they gave us a deluxe double queen room with a view. It was close to the elevator so we could hear it going up and down but that did not bother us too much since we are deep sleepers! Our room did not have a safe so we did end up leaving out laptop etc with the Bellman. The location was great since it was central to everything including the BART which we took to and from the SFO airport. The hotel offers parking which is $48/night with in and out privileges. We were able to find street parking for the night which cost us nothing. You just need to pay attention to the street cleaning signs and parking meter rules. Overall an excellent hotel with a great view."

Warm welcome, large and comfortable room. We had a 2-double-bed bedroom facing the backyard with standard bathroom. The size of the bathroom is the only downside I've found. Very small! However, plenty of hot water (showerhead was not working very effectively...) and very clean bathroom and towels. The morning receptionist (I forgot to ask him his name, but I thank him again) was very nice and accepted to keep our car in the hotel parking until 3:00 p.m. at no charge. This allowed us to go shopping on St. Denis Street without being forced to find a pay parking or to run to a parking meter every 2 hours. Greatly appreciated!"

(Fisherman's wharf, market, ferry to Alcatrez, etc...) Parking very expensive but we found that you can pay for a day in their parkade starting in the morning and do not have to leave until the night of the next day. Almost a two for one deal:-) Otherwise we found parking on the street although my husband mentioned he did not feel altogether safe walking back alone to the hotel after parking.

After a wonderful day &amp; evening in Chicago, my husband &amp; I were very unpleasantly surprised to find out upon checking out the following morning that the parking fee for one overnight at InterContinental Chicago was $49! Yes, this hotel is right on Michigan Avenue, and yes it was a nice room, but $49 for one overnight of parking seemed inordinately high. The usual $35 parking per night in Chicago is high enough, but $49 was over the top; we will not be staying at the InterContinental again! (We booked our room through HotWire, which does not give you the parking fee costs before you book, so we'll also be very leery of using HotWire again."

We brought our bags in, and my husband asked the front desk for directions to their discounted parking garage. In that short 2 minutes of time he received a $115 parking ticket, since there is no place to stop to unload your bags! No warning from the hotel staff either. The room as just okay -- parquet floors in need of refinishing, very small bathroom, nice kitchenette. When we tried to take a shower, hwever, the cold water did not work (the faucet was broken -- how could they not know?).The piece de resistence? The parking garage they directed us to was NOT the one with the discount -- they gave us the wrong directions.....so overnight parking cost $59.Do yourself a favor and pay more money for your room up front."

We had a large clean comfortable room with a king size bed and a very large bathroom on the second floor (no view). The free breakfast was a little crazy, but to be expected located in a tourist mecca. The room rate was a tad expensive, but you are paying for location, location, location. The fee to park was outrageous; $37 per night + 14% tax. Two nights of parking cost $84.00 plus valet tips each time you take the car out. This was painful. I would recommend this hotel, if you can stomach the parking fee and all the tourists."

We thought the rooms were very clean and it was nice to have two bathrooms............ yes, the bathrooms were small but the overall design allows you to move around quite well. I like the contempory design and the flat screen TV'S were a plus (Tv's could use a little update-pic &amp; sound not to good) The only real down fall was PARKING!!! The hotel has no parking so you have to walk about 3 blocks from the 24hr parking garage. We would definitley stay here again!

For about $100 per night we got unbelievable service and a huge room. They do charge for parking but there is a place next door that is a little cheaper. Just remember that you have to pay each time you come and go from the parking lot I think. At the hotel it is also valet parking from the front door. The location is also superb if you want to be near downtown and lots of restaurants. Overall just an incredible place and breakfast is included."

My number one requirement is that they are clean, and the Edwardian was clean. The other positive was its location, with an F line train stop less than one block away, which will take you to Fisherman's Wharf and the rest of the city's sites. Plus, for San Francisco, $120 / night does not get you much. The list of negatives include the hotel loosing our reservation (fixed it with a bit or waiting around), no parking (&quot;parking close by&quot; means five blocks to a secured underground parkade), tiny rooms, and a bed and furniture that are very tired relics from the 70s. All in all, I probably wouldn't stay at the Edwardian again. I'd either spend more on a better hotel with parking, or I'd stay in a suburb like Dublin that is on the BART subway line and ride into downtown for the day."

We brought our bags in, and my husband asked the front desk for directions to their discounted parking garage. In that short 2 minutes of time he received a $115 parking ticket, since there is no place to stop to unload your bags! No warning from the hotel staff either. The room as just okay -- parquet floors in need of refinishing, very small bathroom, nice kitchenette. When we tried to take a shower, hwever, the cold water did not work (the faucet was broken -- how could they not know?).The piece de resistence?

The hotel offers valet and parks around the corner at a parking garage. The fee to park my &quot;oversize&quot ; vehicle would have been $64.00 per day.

You can pre-negotiate room costs &amp; parking with them; I got free parking in downtown plus a nice room for $105.Parking at most hotels is $35-$40 in and of itself. The hotel is cute, small, nice. The location will make or break it for you. It is 3blocks from UnionSquare, one of the nicest and most visited parts of SanFrancisco. In 2blocks the other direction, it is some of the roughest parts of Market. So, go one way , you're in super tourist white light land, the other, and it people smoking dope and sleeping in the street. If you're used to living in a big city, won't bother you. If you're not, it will freak you out. For the money, I do not think there's a better hotel in SanFrancisco."

Could be better organized in that area.

Parking was very tight in the garage and they say parking is $25 but they also charge a $3.50 parking tax upon check out. Room was nice, beds were lumpy and pillows were rock hard. We paid for a bay view, and that was very nice; had a view of the Golden Gate Bridge!! Free breakfast does not start until 6:30 am so if you have an early flight, forget about breakfast.

The rates were great for the area. The parking is $32 a day. Good price for a hotel, but you can find daily parking for less. We never used the car. Room gave us a wonderful view. We were a bit worried because it was next to the elevator but we had no trouble with noise. The security was very good. The desk clerks could have been more friendly. But I had to remind myself we were not in Oklahoma. The gift shop folks were very accomidating. This is where one goes to get services, taxi, tours etc. All in all a nice stay. Will I stay again, No only because we will not need some place with a parking lot and we will stay in a different part of town for variety. Would have been nice to have a comp breakfast."

Not be best area of town alot of homeless people around... This was our first time to San Francisco and we had a hard time locating the hotel. We booked this hotel mainly for the free parking but with a truck it is a tight squeeze in the underground parking. There is a good pizza place across the street but it was a little greasy!!! The rooms were very clean and there was not to much noise. There is a nice courtyard with a fountain and chairs to sit out in during your down time. If you are looking for a budget hotel with free parking this hotel would be fine. Next time we are going to pay the extra for the parking and stay closer to wharf."

I found parking 2 blocks down which was $10 for 24 hours. Not very safe out there at night but then again no where in San Francisco is safe at night. But there is an array of bright lights stating there is a sex shop right in front. Not very pleasing. The room is so small and dusty. BUT i did have a working clock but the alarm did not work but at least it showed the time. Hey if your in for a budget... can't complain. But to be honest I would rather stay in a motel 6 outside of San Francisco than there. The hotel is kind of freaky."

Unfriendly staff, not a pleasant experience. Room looked out onto an abandoned gravel lot with garbage in it. Parking was not mentioned to be a fee when booked. Couldn't park on the street (all restricted areas). Was initially told that parking was around the corner and in thru the wire fence. Couldn't locate parking so asked again to different person. Was then told parking was $15 and not provided by the hotel. Small unsecured lot. I was hoping that my car would still be there in the morning!!! Did not get accomodations I had made a reservation for. Reserved a king, got a queen. Shower curtain was tied back with a piece of toilet paper. Old mini-bar hidden in tv cabinet. Breakfast consisted of Croissants, juice and coffee. Better than nothing. Will never stay at an Econolodge again if this is what to expect."

They have excellent valet parking but SF is well known for it is expensive parking. The on site restaurant is lovely, we enjoyed both dinner and appetizers in the bar during our stay. This hotel is very close to many great restaurants. One of the day desk persons keeps his little dog there with him, very cute. Great little hotel with the ameneties of a larger place. A famous rock band was there during our stay, everything was very quiet and very elegant."

This hotel was conveniently located, walking distance to most places including the Bart and trolley station which is very helpful as a tourist in SF! the view from our room was amazing. the service was prompt, professional and friendly. The bed was the absolute most comfortable bed I've ever slept on, just WOW. i wanted to take that bed, pillows, sheets and everything. haha. They provided us with water and fresh fruit. We had a wonderful time here! My husband loved the modern feel of the interior deco of not only our room but the whole hotel ambiance. the only setback would be parking, $45 for parking at a safe place in their valet garage. But thats a price to pay than to leave your car in one of the parking garages nearby outside where anyone can have access to it. But other than that parking dilleo, everything was perfect. Id definatley come here again, as a matter of fact, We'll be booking this hotel the next time im in the bay area."

It's located a few blocks further from the main shopping and dining attractions than other downtown hotels and as such is price a little lower than similar hotels. The best deal of all is that parking, which can be very expensive in San Francisco, was only $10 a day with a promotional package. The regular parking is $20/day which is still cheaper than many. When you compare hotel room costs in San Franciso, if you need parking for a car, be sure to find out how much it is at each hotel. One hotel we liked alot charged $42.50 per day. That adds a lot to the daily cost."

The self-parking is about 1 block away and is underground/indoor. The gym facilities was one of the best gym facilities that I've seen in a hotel (but I generally stay at lower class hotels). I got overcharged in my minibar tab but hotel staff fixed it when I mentioned the items that I had used (I was charged for a bottle of water which I did not use when I only used/had 2 bottles of alcohol). Wireless Internet was very stable/good and no problems connecting from my room. For the price I paid, it was a nice hotel. However, I would not pay their standard rate of over $150/night since it is expensive for the items that I use."

Great service and a fine dinner - pricey by upstate New York standards but probably in line with New York City prices. We had complimentary breakfast based on our Hilton Honors level. It was a nice buffet or you could order from the menu at no charge. If I was actually paying for breakfast i would have gone somewhere else. $50 for breakfast for two seems like a lot even in New York City."

It's centrally located to most activities. We needed parking for our rental car so we had the &quot;Wharf experience&quot; package that included parking and breakfast for two each day. You have your choice of odering off of the menu or the buffet. I would recommend the buffet. The breakfast was good, but I wouldn't have paid the menu price for it if it were not in our package. Our rate was $225/night incl. parking and breakfast (parking is normally $39/day and breakfast buffet $18/person). Room was very clean and quiet. As mentioned by others, there was not a tub, but we are shower people anyway so it did not matter."

Main reason was to escape the high room rates of the strip hotels. It was a pleasant stay, the bedroom was clean and tidy as was the bathroom. The public areas needed attention, for instance the carpet in the lift hadn't seen a vacuum cleaner for days and the carpet around the lobby area needed a vacuum. The continental breakfast which was included in the room rate was poor. The milk tasted sour and you could have broken a tooth on the raisin bran cereal it was so hard, obviously not Kelloggs!! The fresh fruit was not very nice either. Coffee tasted like dishwater and the toaster took 15 minutes to toast a slice of bread!! Putting the breakfast experience aside, we enjoyed our stay and would probably stay again some time in the future, but would skip the breakfast in favour of the IHOP down the road!!"

(Except for the breakfast) It is in a very good location, close to Sears tower (about a mile), the Navy Pier (1/12 mile) close by the free trolley which you can take to go to the Navy Pier or to museums :) TClose to the business district and a quick ride to Old Town. The hotel is beautiful, super modern and sleek. We had a room on the 10th floor with an awesome view of the River. The bed was super comfy! I'm thinking to buy the mattress from the site. Big plasma TV, a nice longe chair to read by the window. The bathroom double shower, immaculate. The personnel was really nice and help us get orientated in Chicago. Since I was there for a conference I was not impressed with the continental breakfast they provided. Blah! But I went to their sushi bar, excellent! :) Probably the restaurant is better for breakfast. I will definitely stay there again."

Modern design and good furniture, however the renovation budget, reportedly 20 million British pounds was not enough to replace the aged windows. Location is close to the Russell Square tube station and close to the British museum. Price is high but most hotels in London are overpriced and the Russell Hotel is probably just in line with what the market gives. However if breakfast were included in the price, one might coem awya feeling to have gotten a relatively fair deal. At check-in time I was asked if I wanted to add-on breakfasts for 10 ponds a day in advnace, or if not in advnce (at check-in time) it would cost 19 pounds. I decided to go for a short morning stroll to near-by cafes and had breakfasts for under 10 quid, as they say. Otherwise, an acceptable place, worth a try."

However, once we settled in, we were more than happy with our rooms. The breakfast buffet was fantastic, with western, chinese, and japanese breakfast foods. The concierge was also more than helpful.

The Istana for breakfast, the bar in the late evening, the front desk, the houskeepers,the concierge desk---were all eager to please and I hope to return to the Palace again. It was my first stay. No matter where I was in the hotel, all employees seemed to stop and say &quot;Hello and can I help you? &quot; The training of staff must be a huge task......and successful.

However, we booked a room for 4 with a bed and breakfast deal. The room was small for the 4 of us - basically the two double beds took up most of the space. The hotel certainly was not full, and I was surprised they crammed us into the room, although technically speaking, that is what we reseved. Also, the special included only breakfast for 2 people - and it was well over 20$ per person for the breakfast - it was good, very good, but that's a bit pricey!In all fairness, we did get what we paid for, and I can't really compare to other hotels in the area, but I feel it was a bit overpriced for what it is."

This is a really great hotel with the best breakfast, wonderful fruit and fruit juices and decaf coffee - we spent 51 days in the region and this set the standard and was never beaten. Also, very comfy beds (again unusual for this part of the world), great room, flat screen TV and glass walled bathroom with electric blinds. Good location - you can walk to the Hutongs, shopping on Wangfujian and visit the night food market for a wonderful meal and experience and Starbucks is behind the hotel if you need a caffeine fix. We left our baggage at the hotel for 1 week when we went to Mongolia and it was safe and fetched for us with a smile on our return. We had to move back into the Park Plaza on our return, which was also good but the breakfast did not even come close!"

Whilst we loved New York ,the same could not be said of this Hotel. The suites were spacious, but the furniture was soooo uncomfortable. There were no tea or coffee facilities in the suites, and the service was the worst we have ever experianced. Room service was slow, and when it arrived the order was wrong. At breakfast, three of us got breakfast whilst the other two had to wait another twenty minutes, and then they got the wrong order. Better by far to go out for food. But on our third morning it was raining and we decided to try again. Bad decision. Service was even worse,two got breakfast after 25 minutes,the others getting wrong orders after 40 minutes. When we checked out they even gave us the wrong bill. For these prices this level of comfort and service is totally unacceptable. Would we stay here again? No. Absoloutly not. NEVER."

It is by far the best hotel I have visited - point of comparison are the Place d'Armes in Montreal, the Germain in Toronto and the Dominion 1912 in Quebec city. The design is absolutely outstanding. The room was very big. The FLOU bed was extremely comfortable and so were the duvet and pillows. The heated floor in the bathroom was well apreciated. The DVD player in the room was useful to watch our dvds - check out the dvd selection in the lobby - and so was the internet connection in the room. The complimentary breakfast was a nice surprise as you could order great hot breakfast from the kitchen and not just a continental breakfast. The staff was courteous and discreet. Overall a charming and romantic experience. I highly recomend it."

It was great to be able to relax in a large lovely well decorated suite that had a seperate living and bedroom, and a good sized kitchen and bathroom. They must have different sized rooms however, as a couple we talked to were saying how small theirs was. The washing machine and dryer in the bedroom were a huge bonus. Free breakfast, and yes the room was kindof small (around 6 tables) but nothing to stop people taking the breakfast up to their lovely rooms. Yes there are 2 elevators, but we did not mind waiting a minute or so.2 computers near the lobby with free internet, which was great. Staff were very helpful, and recommended an Irish Pub for dinner and had a coupon for a free appetizer. Fabulous location! Right near the start of the magnificant mile, with fantastic views of the river and gorgeous architecture. Would definately stay here again. Thank you Comfort Suites!"

Getting around is a little difficult as it is quite a walk to the subway. Hotel breakfast was included in our package. We really enjoyed the wide variety of Chinese style dishes for breakfast. Very little western style breakfast which did not worry us as we were enjoying the variety. The hotel is located on an interesting hutong (backstreet) which by itself (the hutong) is worth the trip to Beijing. At the end of the street is a nice cafe selling real espresso coffee. There is a bank with ATM around the corner although the exchange rate at the hotel was just the same. I would stay at Shatan Hotel again."

Bathroom was a touch small but this did not really matter. The rooms come with a small kitchenette which is useful. A complimentary breakfast of toast, cereal and juice/tea is provided each day. They do provide a cooked breakfast which costs extra. There are plenty of places to eat breakfast in NYC so we had breakfast elsewhere a couple of times. There is free internet access in the lobby which is a nice touch and the concierge are very helpful. The hotel is about 250m walk from a subway/metro station with a train straight to Times Square etc. Lots of shops are a few blocks away and Central Park is only 10 minutes walk. Overall a great stay and bring ear plugs as NYC is always noisy, especially at night!"

The valet parking is expensive..around $40 with tax, but very convenient - the car is parked in a garage under the hotel. If you want to save money on that, it is possible to park for less just a block or two away. The breakfast is acceptable as a &quot;free&quot; breakfast, but we chose to eat in the Hollywood Cafe next door for an inexpensive big American breakfast ! Overall I'd highly recommend this hotel."

The room was large with an even larger TV. I had breakfast in my room every morning and it was very nice. However the breakfast is $120.00 for 2 people if it is not included in the rate which is very expensive. The only negative with this hotel are the extras as others have pointed out. Car parking was $60.00 a day and a drink being $8.00. I also called for a taxi to Newark airport and the hotel said they could arrange one for $170.00. I took a yellow cab for $70.00 in the end. I stayed at the Sofitel last July and would probably go back to the Sofitel next time as I found it better overall, however the NYP would come a close 2nd."

I stayed at the 4th floor, and is not confortable arrive after an international flght from South America and carry two bags upstairs, in a total of 95 steps! The stairs are steep and narrow. Breakfast is served in the underground. So, after breakfast, only for wash my teeth I should climb 5 floors!!! I did not see (if there's one) a notice about it when I made my reservation. So people with heart disease, older citizens or with problems in the legs (not only disable people) should avoid this hotel. Breakfast is pretty basic. Overall, price is very high if we compare with hotels in US. Well, it is London."

Friendly &amp; helpful staff, free newspaper in foyer and free internet in room. Rooms were quite small (what you would expect in NY) but modern and clean. Free continental buffet breakfast was adequate, but not lavish (the fruit bowl often ran out and they were a bit slow replenishing it). The breakfast room was a bit cramped, simply because it was very popular with the guests - not many other places offered free breakfast. Overall great value for money and top location."

The bar was expensive, $7 for a beer and $12 for a cocktail. Did not hang out at the bar due to this. Found a great bar 1 block from hotel w/ better prices. (DJ Reynolds Irish pub) Lots of great restaurants around the corner. a diner across the street, my husband walked into the diner the morning we left and got us a cappuccino, very good. some street noise during the day, but it seems to quiet down around 10 pm. Would stay here again."

They arranged a taxi transfer to Brunel hotel where I was given a tiny room in the basement. I could hear the underground trains going by every 2-5 minutes so clearly as if a station was next to my room. The kettle turned on randomly (without water!) for some split-seconds, making loud clicking sounds. To make things worse the room was right opposite the breakfast room (~ 6-7 m from bed to breakfast table!) so starting from 7 am constant coming and going. This was definitely the worst stay I ever had. I recommend not accepting any rooms in the basement at all if you have to stay here. Breakfast was very basic, there are lots of restaurants really close that offer much more value for the money, not talking about the atmosphere of a window-less basement breakfast room."

It got to the point where we dreaded going downstairs in the morning for breakfast. The concierge(s) was not very helpful and did not really matter which one was working.

I had to deal with Hotels[-] for a while before getting it resolved and we never did get the breakfast (hotels[-] issued me a credit for the breakfast amt, which by the way was 22 dollars a person for a continental breakfast!!!! ie. juice and muffin .... so I guess I am glad they lost the info) However I had to ask several times to get a cup of coffee. Evidently the hotel only puts out complimentary coffee until 7:30 am! Who gets up that early on vacation? After 7:30 one has to go to the restaraunt and pay through the nose for a cup, I thought this was a four star hotel? One the other side of things the location is great, the service is excellent. The hotel as well is very clean."

We were allowed to check in early, which was fantastic. We were also invited to eat breakfast, which was still being served. The breakfast was your typical hotel breakfast. The hotel lobby and common areas were very nice. We loved the room. Both the room and bathroom were nicely appointed and both very clean. The bed was comfortable. The hotel staff was very friendly as well. The shuttle dropped us off a few times at Mandalay Bay, which was an added bonus, as we were attending events there. If you need a place to stay near the strip that is a great price, this is a great choice."

Hotel is clean and welcoming and extremly well situated but I have to agree with reviewer who complained about the expensive parking charge and the fiasco over breakfast. Although as usual the breakfast is included the room rate was expensive compared to other Holiday Inn Express hotels we have stayed in. The breakfast area was packed out and often nowhere to sit. Many peopel looked around and then had to take breakfast back to their room. Staff seemed to find it difficult to keep the shelves stocked and we were left disappointed with the remaining choice. Because this is a very large, busy hotel perhaps a bit more thought needs to be given to the layout of the breakfast area- moving toastersetc.. Overall I would still recommend thsi hotel as the situation was excellent and the majority of staff extremely helpful."

They arrived after our return and the desk staff neither phoned our room nor gave the letter so both parties waited for an hour, us in our rooms and the relatives in reception."

No hot water at bathroom. On arrival we were told that breakfast is included, but on checkout we charged 600 rhp for breakfast. The breakfast was very poor, and the service poor as well. The train station is about 10 minutes walk, in an unpleasant area. The hotel location is faraway from the tourists' attraction, and the area do not look safe at evening time. The A/C was very noisy, and hardly worked, so the room was hot. It was the worst hotel we had in India. I would not stay there again. I do NOT recommend this hotel. It was a very bad experience. I can not understand the other review."

From the moment we stepped in until last minute we had a wonderful stay. The room was spacious, it had a large flat TV screen the bathroom was really good and everything that you need for a confortable stay. The location of the hotel was really good, 1 block away from the 5th Avenue and 1 from the subway. It's a quiet area but close to everytthing, easy to go downtown (Soho, Greenwich village) or Uptown (to Central Park and all highend shopping). Moreover is one step away from the Empire State building and 20 minutes walk from Time Square. The only downside of the hotel is the breakfast, too expensive and too little. But we only tried once, all the other days we had breakfast at the deli on the corner of the 28th street with 5th Avenue. It was much cheaper and fun to watch the new yorkers rushings to work and having their 3 m breakfast. Enjoy"

Having a car in San Fran makes the world of difference - our previous trips we were reliant on taxis and walking - which was not so bad but to get off the beaten track and see some amazing parts of SF def get a car!The hotel concierge team were great at ensuring we had maps and info. The breakfasts were fine for the included price and they always took great care of our 3 year old. The only complaint we had was the room next door was full of College students who decided to party from 1am until 6am - not great for us at all. Told the hotel who offered us free breakfast but that did not mean much to us as we were already having breakfasts included. All in all I would recommend this hotel to all sorts of groups!"

The staff bends over backwards to see that every wish is taken care of. The rooms are on the small side unless you stay in the jr./mini suite which has a living room. Bathroom is quite small but serviceable however. They have a wonderful restaurant call Abbacato (Italian) which becomes the breakfast place in the morning. Continental breakfast is included and for a small additional cost you can have eggs, breakfast meats, etc. They have an excellent car service to and from the airport at not much more than the price of a cab but certainly more reliable and cleaner. Hotel is within 2 or 3 blocks of the subway. Also, there are plenty of good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Enjoy!!"

I booked through the Montreal tourist office (absolutely fabulous service - always has been) and they spotted a good price (comparable to other 3 stars) that included 2 full breakfasts. When getting to the hotel I found out there were no breakfasts and there hadn't been for 2 months (with the supplying kitchen closed) - total 5$ / night was removed from the bill (a token for two people and the inconvenience). They had not change their listings with the trourist office in this time and I would not have booked there if there was not some breakfast, a basic expectation for small Montreal hotels and B&amp;Bs. The restaurent beside the hotel opens late and closes early. Otherwise desk help was friendly. Parking is 12$ per night in a garage near the hotel - OKThere is great value in Montreal in 2 and 3 stars not to have surprises"

The next morning I went down for breakfast but was told my rate was a bargin rate and did not include breakfast. I had to deal with Hotels[-] for a while before getting it resolved and we never did get the breakfast (hotels[-] issued me a credit for the breakfast amt, which by the way was 22 dollars a person for a continental breakfast!!!! ie. juice and muffin .... so I guess I am glad they lost the info) However I had to ask several times to get a cup of coffee. Evidently the hotel only puts out complimentary coffee until 7:30 am! Who gets up that early on vacation? After 7:30 one has to go to the restaraunt and pay through the nose for a cup, I thought this was a four star hotel? One the other side of things the location is great, the service is excellent. The hotel as well is very clean."

No issues with housekeeping. Concierge LoungeDecent selection at breakfast and happy hour. VERY small seating area -- not really setup for breakfast -- there are maybe 5 tables total -- the rest are more lounge areas which aren't that functional for breakfast.

The staff was very friendly and efficient, however. Breakfast was another problem. The continental style breakfast is fine, and is included in the room rate, but they regularly ran out of a) cutlery b) plates and bowels and c) coffee. It was amusing to watch guests drink milk from bowels or butter croissants with pens. Every now and then a few spoons would appear, which would be quickly pounced on. We finally gave up and just went to the Starbucks next door. Unfortunately, the efficiency of the hotel staff did not extend to the breakfast room."

Friendly staff, rooms were clean and you get complimentary wifi and continental breakfast. Quiet sleep and did not have to wait long for the elevators - longest I waited was possibly 2 minutes one time. The contentental breakfast had a good assortment - fruit, juice, bagels, donuts, yoghurt, cereal and 1 hot egg breakfast - not bad! Right around the corner from Macy's and Herald Square and next to that is Empire State Building - very nice to see at night! I would come here again. For a restaurant, try Nicks &amp; Stef's Steak house $$$ but worth it - near Madison Square Garden. Also, go see Memphis Broadway show - very good show!"

From the moment we got there, the service was fantastic. Doormen were welcoming and friendly, and Tim the concierge manager was amazing. We had a Corner King room and even though it was not huge, it was extremely comfortable and stylish. Breakfast was included in our room rate and instead of the usual, lame continental breakfast, it was a $15pp credit at the restaurant. Needless to say, each day started off with a fantastic breakfast. The rooftop lounge was pretty cool, not too busy when we were there and ideal for late afternoon drinks. We just loved this hotel because of location, service and everything else. This was my fourth time in Chicago, each time at a different hotel, and this was definitely my favorite. Will be staying there from now on."

It is a superb little hotel in a fabulous location. Most of the NY familiar attractions are within walking distance. It is a tastefully decorated old style hotel and spotlessly clean. The rooms are large (for a hotel) and has all the mod cons of any high class hotel. The hotel includes breakfast, which we thought we would not avail of, as we planned to have breakfast in the many diners/delis of NY, but the breakfast was so good and in a very relaxing room we ended having breakfast there every morning. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There is only one lift to service the building and it is a bit slow, however its not as bad as some people have previously mentioned, your on holidays anyway, so whats the rush!!! Conclusion: I would highly recommend this hotel and will be staying here on my next trip to New York. Mark, Kildare, Ireland"

The Empire State building is just around the corner, Time Square 10 minutes walk. Our room had just been refurbished so nice and clean, The staff could have been friendlier. Breakfast was included but it was slight strange as due to the refurbishment breakfast room was relocated but it was too small and often it was difficult to find a seat. I would happily stay there again. Cotffe, orange juice and Red Bull was available for breakfast but the orange juice and Red Bull was in short supply. The staff seemed to keep the drinks hidden behind the bar and they reluctanly gave you some if asked. Can't work out why Red Bull was given out but I got a taste for it after 5 days."

Having a car in San Fran makes the world of difference - our previous trips we were reliant on taxis and walking - which was not so bad but to get off the beaten track and see some amazing parts of SF def get a car!The hotel concierge team were great at ensuring we had maps and info. The breakfasts were fine for the included price and they always took great care of our 3 year old. The only complaint we had was the room next door was full of College students who decided to party from 1am until 6am - not great for us at all. Told the hotel who offered us free breakfast but that did not mean much to us as we were already having breakfasts included. All in all I would recommend this hotel to all sorts of groups!"

The room was good sized for big city hotel rooms, and having two rooms means that everyone is not on top of each other all time. Yes the walls are thin, and you will hear city noise, but what do you expect ? You're not in Kansas. The breakfast was fine, eggs, cereals, yogurt, fruit and breads. No it is not elegant dining but considering what hotels charge for breakfast, it is a significant savings to have a free breakfast when travelling with children. The staff, parking, cleanliness were all good. The location is central for visiting Chicago. And the neighborhood is safe with people out and about at all hours. I would return."

The breakfast really impressed us as we are used to continental breakfasts that consist of little more than donuts and coffee. We feasted on the waffles, bagels, cereal, boiled eggs, pastries, Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches, great coffee, and fruit!The free internet station was invaluable to us in our efforts to get home.

The walls were pretty thin in our room, however, as we could hear the people in the room next door. The hotel was the perfect distance away from the rucus of Times Square, while being a walk away all the attractions. WARNING: DO NOT EAT BREAKFAST AT THIS HOTEL. It costs $30 per person for a very average breakfast.... I strongly recommend eating breakfast at a resto nearby instead... what a ripoff. Would stay here again only if I get a great deal again. This hotel is definitely not work $400+ a night!"

The location is very close to the subway where it can take you uptown or downtown. From here you can get to anywhere in Manhattan quite easily. There are not much nice restaurants around the hotel, but you can quickly go elsewhere via subway. The rooms are small, but more than adequate. Breakfast was very good and was included in the price. The breakfast area was very small and during peak times may be hard to find a table. The serving area was also small, so expect to get friendly with other visitors. :) Breakfast included hot food, fruit, pasteries, muffins, ceral, bread, bagels and numerous spreads. We grabed a few extra fuits and muffins for the day. Internet access was also included in the price. The hotel is faily new and was very pleasant to stay in. Would stay here again."

Everything else was in clean and in order. It is not a 5 star hotel. 3 or 4 stars are more appropriate. Staff was excellent-- very good service and well trained. Internet worked fine. Location in the French Concession area was a plus for me. It had a feel like we were in a neighborhood where people actually lived. The taxi to places of interest is very cheap ( 11 Renmenbi to the Bund). Be aware that taxis can be hard to get in some places, like the Old City area, during rush hour. We had a free breakfast coupon as part of the tour package. The breakfast buffet at the top (a revolving restaurant) was excellent with chinese and western food choices. We had one night not part of the tour and the charge for breakfast was about 170 Renmenbi."

We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $69 (normal rate was around $200). The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed. Hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient. Parking is very expensive at $50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $30. We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere. We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict. They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we did not expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast. Glad we did not pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better. I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit."

Having read some of the previous reviews I was a little nervous about staying here but our experience was very good. We booked directly with the hotel and got a very good deal which included breakfast. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a huge choice. The rooms were quite small but clean and comfortable. The bed one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The bathroom was a little tired but clean and perfectly adequate. The staff I dealt with, with the very notable exception of the woman making waffles at breakfast who was extraordinarily rude, were helpful and polite. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and I would happily return."

Friendly staff, rooms were clean and you get complimentary wifi and continental breakfast. Quiet sleep and did not have to wait long for the elevators - longest I waited was possibly 2 minutes one time. The contentental breakfast had a good assortment - fruit, juice, bagels, donuts, yoghurt, cereal and 1 hot egg breakfast - not bad! Right around the corner from Macy's and Herald Square and next to that is Empire State Building - very nice to see at night! I would come here again. For a restaurant, try Nicks &amp; Stef's Steak house $$$ but worth it - near Madison Square Garden. Also, go see Memphis Broadway show - very good show!"

Every morning the hotel staff would send asian origin customers to an alternate breakfast area at the back of the hotel where it was cold, little choice of food and lack of staff and no cuttery avaliable. Western customers were allowed to enter the main breakfast area even though I was told prior to them that the room was full.

Also, they had soft music playing after housekeeping had been in the room. We also had a complimentary buffet breakfast each day of our stay, which was tasty. They offered an American breakfast as well as a Japanese breakfast at the buffet. The concierge was extremely helpful and was knowledgeable."

The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Maid service kept everything refreshed and clean. The bathroom looked like it was recently remodeled. The wifi worked very well, one of the best for a motel that I've used. The breakfast was modest, but adequate and there are a couple of breakfast spots within half a block. Our room offered a fridge and microwave plus the standard coffee maker. A mini mart is across the street. We particulary enjoyed the getting our breakfast at a Korean restaurant run by a very nice couple that was half a block on 9th street towards Market Street. The Rodeway Inn was convenient to Market Street, BART, MUNI (the bus line) and the Civic Center. We found the location to be a good base for a vacation in San Francisco."

What let the place down though was the staff when something went wrong. We have 2 teenage boys and had no TV the whole time we were there and no-one cared. Don't whatever you do buy the buffet breakfast - rip off! When things run out that's just your tough luck cause they do not refil it. Go to the 10th Avenue diner (out the hotel turn left) as their breakfast is fab! The room and bathroom were clean and the parking was excellent as well. The hotel is well situated for Times Square and some excellent restaurants in Hells Kitchen. Most miserable member of staff award goes to the woman on the ticket desk at the Natural History Museum!"

When we got there we were too early for check in so they held our bags for us (the doorman/bag man was sooooo grumpy). We came back at 2pm to check in and was told it would be another 20 minutes so we waited in the breakfast room, well 1hr 45 mins later we finally checked in! The reception staff were really nice and friendly! The room was great (room 414) much bigger than i had expected, we had lots of space! We could not have wished for a better location, just around the corner from Times Square. I think would take us about 3 minutes to get to the centre. The room was cleaned every day and the lifts worked fine! We didnt have the breakfast as i thought it was overpriced! There was lots of places just down from the hotel to have breakfast. All in all the Hotel was fab!"

Location is close to the Russell Square tube station and close to the British museum. Price is high but most hotels in London are overpriced and the Russell Hotel is probably just in line with what the market gives. However if breakfast were included in the price, one might coem awya feeling to have gotten a relatively fair deal. At check-in time I was asked if I wanted to add-on breakfasts for 10 ponds a day in advnace, or if not in advnce (at check-in time) it would cost 19 pounds. I decided to go for a short morning stroll to near-by cafes and had breakfasts for under 10 quid, as they say. Otherwise, an acceptable place, worth a try."

I booked through the Montreal tourist office (absolutely fabulous service - always has been) and they spotted a good price (comparable to other 3 stars) that included 2 full breakfasts. When getting to the hotel I found out there were no breakfasts and there hadn't been for 2 months (with the supplying kitchen closed) - total 5$ / night was removed from the bill (a token for two people and the inconvenience). They had not change their listings with the trourist office in this time and I would not have booked there if there was not some breakfast, a basic expectation for small Montreal hotels and B&amp;Bs. The restaurent beside the hotel opens late and closes early. Otherwise desk help was friendly. Parking is 12$ per night in a garage near the hotel - OKThere is great value in Montreal in 2 and 3 stars not to have surprises"

We needed a cheap hotel for our last night in London and we liked the Gloucester Road area. They quoted us a price of 75 pounds and my husband bargained the rate down to 65 pounds. Our room was larger than I expected for a budget hotel. It had a double bed and also a twin bed. The down side was the bathroom was the size of a closet but it was clean and there was plenty of hot water. Also, the bed was extremely hard but it was okay for one night. Breakfast was included in the rate. The free breakfast consisted of coffee, tea or juice and toast. Anything else was extra but the free breakfast was adequate. Would probably stay there again if nothing else was available mainly because I liked the area."

Front desk staff was very unfriendly and not helfpful at all. I am a Gold Hilton Honors member and usually receive two complimentary breakfasts at the Urban Tavern; complimentary breakfast was a grande beverage and a pastry at Starbucks. In the past I have been treated to a nice continental sit-down breakfast in the Urban Tavern with hot oatmeal and fresh fruit and pastries. My room was in tower 3 with no view of the city at all; we could barely see the sky from our window. I was given a key to the mini bar, but there was no mini bar in the room. When I called customer service, the gentleman who answered the phone acted as though I were bothering him. The price would really have to be right in order for me to stay in this hotel again."

Travelling back in summer might involve a long wait. The room was palatial, clean and very comfortable. I could hear my neighbours quite clearly however. Breakfast was included within my package deal with Virgin Holidays although the hotel were unaware of this. They were very helpful and gave me complimentary breakfast each day and did not even charge me for phone call made. This was great as the breakfasts were AMAZING - certainly 5 star and not cheap either! I was suprised that rooms didnt have tea/coffee facilities - every hotel I've been in have this. They told me that 24 hour room service was available, but that's not the same as making yourself a quick cuppa in the morning. However, a great stay."

There was a flat screen tv in the living room and a conventional one in the bedroom for those that care :) As it was a reward night, room service delivered free bottles of water to the room. A nice touch. The bed was luxurious and very hard to get out of in the morning!Ah breakfast! Other people have mentioned it but a free cooked breakfast is fantastic. I ate two omelets they were that good. Location wise, it was a 10 - 15 minute walk to Navy Pier and shopping and a subway stop were very close by. Overall, a great stay."

Booked after reading previous write-ups and was not disappointed. Lovely hotel with absolutely wonderful staff from which nothing is too much trouble from the front desk staff to the lady that cleaned our room everyone was polite and made us feel welcome. The rooms are lovely, we shared a deluxe twin with balcony. Large room with loads of mirrors (just what a sixteen year old needs). Bathroom was well stocked with plenty of excellent products. Complimentary breakfast is good but would say that it would be great if they could provide a cooked breakfast or buffet, but this will in now way stop us from staying there again and I will definitely recommend it to all my friends. Hotel is in a good area within walking distance of shops and a metro on the doorstep. Definitely a good place to stay and would be more than a 3.5* if they provided a buffet breakfast."

First off, there were only three small elevators in the hotel so it would take forever for you to get up to your room. The elevators were always crammed and tight. Breakfast was included and I loved making my own belgian waffles in the morning, but on weekdays breakfast ends at 9:30am which I feel is too early when you have been out late during days at the Jazz festival. Also, there aren't many tables for breakfast so you might have to wait a while to grab a seat, if it is busy. One other problem was that the pool is small and there are no changerooms so you have to change in the bathroom. Other than those problems, my stay at the Residence Inn was okay and the hotel is right downtown."

Thus the location is good even though 8th avenue is a little gloomy at night. The Hotel is quite new, and the staff is friendly. All in all we we can recommend this hotel for a quick trip to NY. It is good value for money, but do not expect too much though. One thing you shouldn't choose this hotel for is the breakfast. That was simply a joke!

A year later we returned to find the hotel in the middle of a takeover by easyjet(everything bright orange) but had not been told this on booking. The room was small, the wardrobe had gone(we were left with 2 coathangers), and everything was bright orange(not for the fainthearted).Also around us were building materials and paint. When we went down to breakfast on the first morning we were told it was not at the hotel but we could have a voucher for McDonalds down the road(not appealing at the best of times).I just feel we should have been told about the refit and lack of breakfast and then we could have made the choice of whether to stay or book somewhere else. The only saving grace were the polite staff."

You are better off trying to get a discount by getting a room without breakfast. Evening meals meanwhle are overpriced and nothing special, you are better off going out to eat. Our delux room was extremely comfortable and easily the cleanest place we stayed in India, but had no window and had an annoying dripping tap.i found the service to be good. One thing, and I am being pedantic but... laundry is overpriced and then it all comes back with a number written in marker pen on each individual piece that even now, 6 weeks later refuses to come off. It was also late coming back, turned up with extra items that I sent back.. and was promptly charged for anway."

However the rooms and the lobby required a bit of getting used to... clean but spare. Booked through Quikbook and upon confirming reservation I asked for a room with a view. Got just the opposite however.. a room on the second floor in the back overlooking the interior of the hotel. The neighborhood also seemed a little seedy at times despite the fact that the hotel is positioned right at the top of the Park avenue south area. The free breakfast was wonderful however. It reminded me a little of an English breakfast in a European hostel and it really made this hotel selection worthwhile. All types of pastries, fruit, cereal, boiled eggs, yogurt, bagels, granola bars..perfect."

We booked our room using Expedia, which makes me wonder if this had any affect on the location of our room assignment. We were located right beside the breakfast reception area. The noise from staff setting up the breakfast each morning distrubed our sleep. We were woke up at 6:45 a.m. to the sounds of clanging dishes and other usual kitchen noises. We also heard other guests enjoying their breakfast all morning long, as we tried to catch a few more moments of sleep. We did request a room change, but the hotel was fully occupied. But all this said - we would stay at this hotel again. I would just request a room towards the back of the hotel, to ensure a quieter morning."

It was a pretty good deal considering that it included daily buffet breakfast. The breakfast was wonderful, every possible choice, including fresh omelettes made to order. Hotel was clean, staff friendly. My only concern was that we were told that we were connected to underground shopping, I assumed that it would be connected to the eaton center somehow, but it was not. You have a mall (complexes dejardins) downstairs, but you'll have to walk a couple of blocks before you get to the main shopping area. This hotel is quite far from the main area (too east), next time I'm going to stay at a hotel more on the west end, but I'll definitely miss the buffet breakfast!!"

However, we booked a room for 4 with a bed and breakfast deal. The room was small for the 4 of us - basically the two double beds took up most of the space. The hotel certainly was not full, and I was surprised they crammed us into the room, although technically speaking, that is what we reseved. Also, the special included only breakfast for 2 people - and it was well over 20$ per person for the breakfast - it was good, very good, but that's a bit pricey!In all fairness, we did get what we paid for, and I can't really compare to other hotels in the area, but I feel it was a bit overpriced for what it is."

We were allowed to check in early, which was fantastic. We were also invited to eat breakfast, which was still being served. The breakfast was your typical hotel breakfast. The hotel lobby and common areas were very nice. We loved the room. Both the room and bathroom were nicely appointed and both very clean. The bed was comfortable. The hotel staff was very friendly as well. The shuttle dropped us off a few times at Mandalay Bay, which was an added bonus, as we were attending events there. If you need a place to stay near the strip that is a great price, this is a great choice."

Its ideally situated as its a five minute walk from times square and close to the subways. I felt very safe in the vacinity of the hotel. Our room was on the inside of the hotel and our view was of offices and not very exciting. But I certainly didnt spend much time in the room looking out of my window!I found the hotel very clean, the staff were helpful and the room although not huge, was perfect for our needs. The bonus is the breakfast that is provided free. I found that lots of hotels dont do breakfasts as new yorkers eat out. We saved a lot of money that we would have spent on breakfasts. If I ever return to New York I will definitely stay here again."

The 2 speciality Chinese restaurants were reasonably priced and served good food.

When you come towards East Nanjing road, you really can't miss it. The service is good and the staff speaks decent English. The rooms are nice but the best thing about this hotel is the breakfast buffet. We've got a good deal with Hotels.com and paid EUR 125 (including breakfast) so that was a very good deal. The only bad thing of the hotel is the high charge for using the internet (EUR 1 per 2 minutes). But since internet is only available in the top hotels, you do not have much choice. If you like shopping, then East Nanjing Road is the place to be. I personally like the French Concession more because I like the nice little boutiques and the best restaurants are situated there."

We were very happy here. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because 2 days in a row the front desk gave us wrong information about concierge level lounge. So two mornings in a row, we missed breakfast. However, we told them to compensate us for a breakfast downstairs and they did. The breakfast buffet, by the way, is amazing. We were also given usage of the complementry house car. That was a great touch. My husband had his suit dry cleaned while we were here, and it was picked up and dropped off same day in our room. Great hotel in a great location in Union Square."

Friendly and professional valet service. One of the best breakfasts in Montreal. The only small problem was that we had booked all 4 of our rooms on Expedia, and breakfast was to be included, but for some reason the hotel would only provide breakfast vouchers for 3 of the rooms, even though there were 5 people staying in the 4 rooms. It was not clear why some rooms came with vouchers, and others did not, considering they all were booked at the same time and for the same rate. We reached a compromise, where the hotel agreed to pay for 4 of the 5 breakfasts."

Breakfast was a lovely if you were allowed in breakfast area. With the excuse of a full breakfast area ( even though room would not be half filled). Every morning the hotel staff would send asian origin customers to an alternate breakfast area at the back of the hotel where it was cold, little choice of food and lack of staff and no cuttery avaliable. Western customers were allowed to enter the main breakfast area even though I was told prior to them that the room was full. When asked for an explanation, the hotel staff (Jenny) ignored me and pretended that she did not understand, waving her hand to gesture me to leave. Overall very dissappointed with this hotel and never stay there again."

I picked this hotel because it was within walking distance to things we wanted to see, but then we never did any walking. Took taxis everywhere. Due to congestion in front of the hotel, taxi drivers may drop you off the block before. Some taxi drivers had difficulty finding the place, so be sure to take a map of its location with you. Hotel was very clean, and the front desk staff spoke very good English. Breakfast is 30 yuan (approx $5.10US), and changes many items daily. Compared to what we pay in the US for breakfast, it was very good value, but you need to like to eat vegetables for breakfast. Several times we ate food from nearby street vendors, and had breakfasts for 3rmb. We hated Shanghai (much prefer Beijing), but if we ever go back, we would stay there again."

When checking in we were told the continental breakfast was free, but the hot breakfast was not. I had eggs and coffee, my wife had a bagel and coffee. We were charged $14 for hot breakfast and $10 for continental. I complained to manager at checkout and he said &quot;I find it hard to believe that you were told the continental breakfast was free.&quot; I asked if he found it easier to believe that I was lying... he then said &quot;you consumed the breakfast, you have to pay for the breakfast.&quot; To avoid a fight I just paid, but will never stay there again. The Sheraton and the Marriott cost about the same, but are much classier hotels."

Location was convenient to the night market, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square - all an easy walk. (Ignore the constant pestering for people to give you a lift there ... it is a quick and easy walk.) Price (about $140 on Travelocity) seemed fair given the location - could have found cheaper but would have been less convenient to the sights. Breakfast was pricey ... we did not purchase a room package that included breakfast - maybe that would have been cheaper. Just walking in and paying was $50 for two of us - OUCH. It was a standard buffet with lots of options, but no buffet breakfast is worth $25 a pop! Room itself was fine ... not huge, but I think that's the norm. Room was clean and had everything we needed."

So two mornings in a row, we missed breakfast. However, we told them to compensate us for a breakfast downstairs and they did. The breakfast buffet, by the way, is amazing. We were also given usage of the complementry house car. That was a great touch. My husband had his suit dry cleaned while we were here, and it was picked up and dropped off same day in our room.

We wanted to visit the San Gennaro feast. I must say we were pleasantly surprised. The room was clean and well-decorated. We had a mini-fridge, a safe and continental breakfast. The breakfast room had cereal, juice ,toast, waffles,and muffins. The only setback is that it is small(4 tables).Then there were some selfish people there who sat and chatted at a table for about 20 minutesafter they had finished while some people had to eat breakfast on a chair. The staff was very helpful when we asked for directions. If you're expecting the Waldorf Astoria, do not book there. But if you want a clean and comfortable hotel at a reasonable price, the Seaport fits the bill."

Our room was on the 6th floor (HHonours guests are allocated top floor rooms). Three elevators let you get there easily. The rooms aren't huge but good enough for the low price. Great value because of the evening &quot;Happy hour&quot; and the breakfast buffet. Their &quot;Made to order&quot; breakfasts are to die for ! Try the meat lovers omelet with some extra bacon and sausage, hash browns, french toast, milk, juice, toast and fruit. A real heart attack special. You can gain weight at this hotel just like on a cruise ship. Just kidding .... but their Omelets are really tasty. The rooms are quiet but sometimes the incoming planes look like the could land on the roof. Thanks for your time."

Neutrals: the breakfast was adequate ( but certainly a value compared to buying at a restaurant).Negatives : the rooms were dark. (I do not so much object to the color of the decor, which was maroon-ish, as to the use of fluorescent bulbs in every fixture. Hey, I'm as green as the next guy, but face it, fluorescents cast a cold, dim, gloomy light.) And the common areas were small and dreary. (The entry off the street almost looks like the freight entrance. And the combined front desk/breakfast room/business center was painfully small. For the first couple of days we were there, the presence of two tour groups plus the rest of the guests made breakfast seem like New Year's Eve on Times Square.)All of that said, I do recommend the hotel. But third-best in Chicago? I really do not think so."

I have never seen made to order omelettes and good quality ingredients like this at a complimentary breakfast. I disagree with the reviewer that said the place was noisy - I hear nary a peep from the approxmately 100 children staying at the hotel (they did run amok at breakfast) and the facilities were very clean, recently remodeled with plasma screens adn the like. One peeve was the chlorine odor in the atrium - the pool should have had it is own ventilation. Awesome location (blue line to clark/lake) and a $5 cab ride - 60 minutes and $7 total! The best airport transfer deal in a big city. Parking is a rip if you drove, but the lot across the street is $19 a night if you do not mind parking outside."

The rooms (allocated to me and my group) were very small, dark, with little daylight, backing on to a multistory car park. There were no hotel facilities at all! Only vending machines. No bar, cafeteria, restaurante, business center, nothing. A disappointing continential breakfast was served on the first floor in a small area with only 7 or 8 tables, and a funny kind of sofa arrangement. There was not enough space for all the guests wanting to take breakfast to sit down, and many had to stand up. The plates, glasses and cutlery were all plastic. The second day we all went out for breakfast. I guess this place would be okay for low budget travellers with low expectations, but it is by no means a mid-class establishment."

In spite of all this, the charges for food were like 4-5* hotels. They charged 45Rs for a cup of tea and more than 200Rs/person for useless breakfast. The staff was rude. At first they told that the breakfast was complimentary. But after we had the breakfast, they said it is not. After lot of arguing, I had to pay for that.

Was in Room 10A, no view but did not mind since you do not spend time in the room and it was quiet for sleeping. Great location in between Crysler and Empire State and close to Grand Central. Bathroom and kitchenette could do with upgrading but room was big, with high ceilings and a huge bed and temperature was warm. For the price, breakfast probably should be provided but difficult to find a hotel in NYC that does. Highly recommend Scottys diner across the street - cheap and cheerful. Got breakfast there for 4 times less than what we paid for the same breakfast near madison square gardens. Would recommend the hotel. For visiting NYC on a budget, recommend the NY public library &amp; the free staten island ferry. Beware that most restaurants put the tip now on the bill so no need to pay extra."

I like that they served cooked oatmeal rather than packets of instant-oats which so many other hotels have with their free breakfast. The fruit was fresh and sweet. We were there on business and never tried the pool or fitness center. It seems like a place where you could stay easily with kids. Our beds were comfy. I like the furniture. They provided shampoo, conditioner, and soap in our room. We asked the friendly competent front desk staff and were immediately given shower cap, body lotion, etc. I guess they arent putting one of everything in the rooms now to prevent waste? My partner comment on how well trained staff was...several times."

They did not tell us that upon checking in. If you did not bring your own toothbrush &amp; toothpaste, you'd have to buy them from the minibar; same goes for shaving kit. The location is great as Rue Crescent is around the corner (many bars,restaurants,cafes), the metro and the underground mall are also a couple of blocks away. In the end, we ended up paying the equivalent for the 3rd night through breakfast and parking ($16/night)."

The restuarants are also much better value in this neighbourhood than downtown. The staff were wonderul and always willing to help. The rooms of very high standard and extremely comfortable. They do a very simple buffet breakfast - nothing special but was included in the price. You can take your breakfast up to your room - which is quite helpful as the space and seating in reception is not really geared up for eating breakfast. They also have tea and coffee on tap 24/7. This is a great hotel and really is home from home. I will certainly stay here again."

The breakfast buffet was beyond our belief. What a great assortment and if they did not have it made, they graciously cooked whatever we wanted to our specifications. Didn't have to take the little ones through all the crowded mobs in the bigger gambling casinos. The one closer to the airport is within a block of the Hard Rock and another casino so we could just walk there. Would take us to the strip and pick us up. Didn't even need a car. Beds very comfortable and room for more people on the queen couch-comfortable also. Great vacation. Thanks to the Embassy Suites staff."

The hotel is convenient for viewing Fishermans' Wharf, the crooked road and to get to trams. The room we were given had a wonderful view of the Golden Gate Bridge and we had no complaints regarding the size or cleanliness. The biggest problem was breakfast time! This only ran until 9.30 and so everyone headed down at 9am arrving at the same time. The breakfast room was just not large enough to hold everyone so there was an &quot;overflow&quot; into the reception area. One morning we ended up eating out there on sofas, hoping that a table would turn up eventually. The breakfast buffet was pleasant enough, but it was a bit of a scramble amongst all the other guests (who'd arrived at the same time!!)Comfort Inn - you need to sort this out with an extension!Anyway, a nice hotel for the price, but head down early for breakfast!!"

Main reason was to escape the high room rates of the strip hotels. It was a pleasant stay, the bedroom was clean and tidy as was the bathroom. The public areas needed attention, for instance the carpet in the lift hadn't seen a vacuum cleaner for days and the carpet around the lobby area needed a vacuum. The continental breakfast which was included in the room rate was poor. The milk tasted sour and you could have broken a tooth on the raisin bran cereal it was so hard, obviously not Kelloggs!! The fresh fruit was not very nice either. Coffee tasted like dishwater and the toaster took 15 minutes to toast a slice of bread!! Putting the breakfast experience aside, we enjoyed our stay and would probably stay again some time in the future, but would skip the breakfast in favour of the IHOP down the road!!"

As others have written, the hotel is conveniently located. Its within walking distance to the subway and theaters. Our cab ride from La Guardia to the hotel was about $35. The staff served us excellently . The hotel was rennovating the hall way on the floor we stayed on -- wall coverings were taken off, etc. So, you may want to ask if they are rennovating the floor when it comes time to get your room. As HHonors members we received a free daily breakfast. The breakfast was in the hotel's Pigalle restaurant and the breakfast menu was limited. Amongst the choices were eggs, omlets, a waffle dish and granola dish. Free wireless worked well. We also used the free printers downstairs to print out tickets. We had a pleasant stay at this hotel."

Location was convenient to the night market, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square - all an easy walk. (Ignore the constant pestering for people to give you a lift there ... it is a quick and easy walk.) Price (about $140 on Travelocity) seemed fair given the location - could have found cheaper but would have been less convenient to the sights. Breakfast was pricey ... we did not purchase a room package that included breakfast - maybe that would have been cheaper. Just walking in and paying was $50 for two of us - OUCH. It was a standard buffet with lots of options, but no buffet breakfast is worth $25 a pop! Room itself was fine ... not huge, but I think that's the norm.

The staff bends over backwards to see that every wish is taken care of. The rooms are on the small side unless you stay in the jr./mini suite which has a living room. Bathroom is quite small but serviceable however. They have a wonderful restaurant call Abbacato (Italian) which becomes the breakfast place in the morning. Continental breakfast is included and for a small additional cost you can have eggs, breakfast meats, etc. They have an excellent car service to and from the airport at not much more than the price of a cab but certainly more reliable and cleaner. Hotel is within 2 or 3 blocks of the subway. Also, there are plenty of good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Enjoy!!"

There was a nice little balcony that we could sit out and look onto the street in the evenings (there was a heatwave when we were there). However, our little table on the balcony disappeared on our first night here so we did not get to sit outside. This was not really a problem though as there was so much else to do, and the location of the hotel was great- right beside the underground and easy to get around anywhere we wanted. The breakfast was not up to much, but continental breakfast's never really are (in my opinion) but it was well advertised beforehand that this was the only breakfast choice available and so we did not mind. All in all, it was a decent enough hotel in a good location and for a reasonable price."

I want to commend the staff at this hotel. Our luggage was lost and the concierge went out of his way to call the airlines to help us locate the luggage. Also, my wallet was stolen out of my purse. Don't know how this happened because I'm always so careful - so please be very diligent in paying attention to your purse. The front desk called the police department for me and also followed up with a phone call to see how everything went. Also, when I checked out, the girl asked me if I had gotten my wallet back. Of course I hadn't. If I ever went back to London, I would definately stay here again."

Couldn't have been more convenient for everything including all public transport. Fantastic value for money given its location. Probably more like a good hostel than a hotel - no problems with staff, lift, cleanliness, noise etc. Room was basic with no frills (but it did have tv and phone)Breakfast was toast, jam, bagels, cream cheese, enormous muffins, OJ, coffee and tea and you could have as much as you like - I thought it was fair enough that you couldn't load up with food to take to your room - its only meant to be your breakfast not food for all day - I was pleased to get breakfast at all for the price - in France, Italy etc you're lucky to just get one croissant and a cup of coffee."

It was very convenient having the kitchenette at our disposal. We went to a nearby store(White Hen) and bought snacks, Milk, Pop,etc and had our refridgerator and microwave at our fingertips. The big surprise was the free breakfast in the morning. They told us there was a buffet breakfast,but we thought cereal and donuts. We were pleasantly surprised to find a full breakfast with eggs,potatoes, ham ,biscuits and gravy, juice,cereal ,everything we could possibly want.... Our suite was pleasant and impeccably clean.

I had to deal with Hotels[-] for a while before getting it resolved and we never did get the breakfast (hotels[-] issued me a credit for the breakfast amt, which by the way was 22 dollars a person for a continental breakfast!!!! ie. juice and muffin .... so I guess I am glad they lost the info) However I had to ask several times to get a cup of coffee. Evidently the hotel only puts out complimentary coffee until 7:30 am! Who gets up that early on vacation? After 7:30 one has to go to the restaraunt and pay through the nose for a cup, I thought this was a four star hotel? One the other side of things the location is great, the service is excellent.

A much appreciated exceptional treatment was the opening of the Club room at 4:30 am for this insomniac still on European time to work on the computer without distrubing his wife! The breakfast is the best continental breakfast I have seen and the beds were extremely comfortable. A great location tops it off and we will be return visitors for sure. Gary"

The rate included breakfast, which was very nice for an inclusive breakfast, several hot items, many pastries, cereals and fruits. The pool was located on the top floor, and although a bit small, kept the children happy. However, there was very limited seats - about 8 total! We were a healthy 15 minute walk to shopping, but the doormen were very attentive and we were able to get a taxi quickly. We did not use the valet parking, which at $38/night is a bit steep. We had a relative who let us use her parking pass down the street."

The rooms are great - very comfy beds, nice big bathrooms with great amenities, nice tvs. We had dinner and drinks in the bar/lounge in the lobby and the food was delicious! And they provide breakfast the next morning. We were not going to be there when they served breakfast so they provided a boxed breakfast for us to pick up on our way out of the hotel!They also provide a &quot;park and stay&quot;. So we left our vehicle there for the duration of our trip. I would definitely stay here again if I needed an overnight stay at the Montreal Airport!"

I found it very quiet, 18th floor. We did not really notice the traffic noise and did not hear much &quot;hotel&quot; noise. We did, however, have the air conditioning fan on all the time for buffer. The free breakfast in the morning is awesome: Hot things like eggs, sausages, waffles, French toast, cereal, fruit, bagels, juice, coffee, you name it. Lots of space to sit and eat your breakfast. On the weekend they provided plastic cutlery and plates, so that you could take your breakfast up to your room. I would highly recommend this to everyone. My daughter is 16, but we saw a lot of people there with little kids."

The next morning we went looking for the &quot;breakfast included&quot; and found a sorry-looking plate on the front desk with a couple of Nutrigrain bars and plastic-wrapped Danish, an instant coffee flask and some hot water. Not my idea of breakfastespecially as we had stayed the night before at a Residence Inn in S. San Francisco where there was a full range of food choices. I was not impressed, would not stay there again and feel there are better choices than this hotel for a similar price."

This trip, our first room had double beds so I asked to be moved to a king and was accommodated the next day. They have a good Continental breakfast but cafes and restaurants are close by. Breakfast is $6, for New York that's not too bad. We ate across the street at Norma's in the Le Parker Meridien for 4 times that one morning. Some of the Salisbury staff are helpful and some are not. Bellman are efficient, housekeeping is a bit slow. The breakfast room attendants are courteous and efficient. You will hear at least three languages spoken by hotel guest at breakfast for this hotel is frequented by English, German, and French tourists. There is construction going on in the same block so there are some noise issues. However, this is a good, clean, safe spot to stay in New York."

Later on in March, when my Visa bill arrived, they had charged me $205 for Breakfast !! and it was not on the bill i signed on departure. I fired off an few e-mails, and eventually got a refund, but just beware !! - Otherwise we thought the hotel looked a bit tired, and the rooms were a little small.

I also wish they would have told me that the parking package didnt include all that it said on the website, e.g.-that evening drinks and snacks are not included, since the bar and restaurant are being renovated. Although they did manage to provide breakfast. But, all in all we loved the charm and ambience of this old world hotel."

I had to stand in the basement floor hallway and use the public iron on a disintegrating ironing board. Unacceptable, and hard to find as well. Breakfast was toast, bread or cornflakes. As cost included breakfast, I was stuck with paying for my breakfast elsewhere and not claiming it back. No A/C and the room was HOT. Additionally, there were women screaming across the courtyard and wolf whistling at guests who had opened the windows and curtains in an attempt to cool their rooms. This went on until midnight. The shower was like a hot coffin and the air extractor sounded like a helicopter. There were not many directions plates, and the hallways were like a maze. There was one lift for the whole hotel, so I tried the stairs, and got lost more than once. A credit card scan was taken, but I was asked to pay on the evening before I checked out. Why?Decor was very dated."

The location is excellent - in the middle of Chinatown, blocks away from Little Italy, and very close proximity to the subway. The staff was helpful and efficient. Beds were very comfortable and rooms were well done with flat screen tv's, in room safe, and other amenities. My only recommendation is NOT to stay on the second floor, just steps away from the registration desk , offices, and the breakfast area. It can be very loud, especially in the mornings as people begin having breakfast and checking out."

One thing you have to bear in mind though is that when you're staying in central location it is bound to be noisy! The hotel staff were friendly, courteous and very helpful. There very good diners around the hotel so you won't go to bed hungry. My only issue was with breakfast because there was not a continental breakfast menu available anywhere. It's all about 3-4 or more egg omlette, pancakes, steak etc. Howevery San Francisco is wonderfully diverse city. There is always something new around the corner so even if you do not get breakfast a satisfiying lucn &amp; dinner is guaranteed. Muir Woods &amp; Sausalito are both unmissable."

At first they told that the breakfast was complimentary. But after we had the breakfast, they said it is not. After lot of arguing, I had to pay for that.

As was mentioned in other reviews the rooms were small but clean the staff was very helpful and it is in a great location. Close to cable cars, Chinatown and Union Square. I chose this hotel because of the reviews that menioned how good the breakfast buffet was. Upon Checking in I was told that they no longer served a breakfast. Had I known this I would have chosen a different hotel. Their renovation was not complete and we had to walk around the workmen and their ladders, the smell of paint was strong in the lobby and dust was heavy at times."

We had booked via travelzoo and the rate included breakfast but this component of the reservation did not seem to get into the hotel system. I had the original documentatioon from travelzoo so after approximately 5 minutes we were provided with the breakfast coupons. The location is very good, we are frequent travelers to Montreal and the hotel is close to everything downtown and the metro. Rooms were fine, a bit dated but clean and the housekeeping staff assigned to our room usually had our room cleaned by early afternoon. The buffet breakfast was good with a selection of hot and cold items but was a bit expensive $20 if it was not included with your room rate."

Neutrals: the breakfast was adequate ( but certainly a value compared to buying at a restaurant).Negatives : the rooms were dark. (I do not so much object to the color of the decor, which was maroon-ish, as to the use of fluorescent bulbs in every fixture. Hey, I'm as green as the next guy, but face it, fluorescents cast a cold, dim, gloomy light.) And the common areas were small and dreary. (The entry off the street almost looks like the freight entrance. And the combined front desk/breakfast room/business center was painfully small. For the first couple of days we were there, the presence of two tour groups plus the rest of the guests made breakfast seem like New Year's Eve on Times Square.)All of that said, I do recommend the hotel. But third-best in Chicago? I really do not think so."

The free cocktail each evening was nice &amp; the nibbles were decent (an unfortunate sea of styrofoam cups, however). However, the much vaunted &quot;cooked to order breakfast&quot; was a chaotic, unpleasant ordeal each morning. We felt like cattle waiting to be served at the trough. There was insufficient seating, and the entire environment reeked of make-shift disposable (ugly folding tables/chairs, ugly plastic trays, and again a miserable waste of styrofoam cups).Dread of the breakfast pandemonium would cause hesitation in whether to stay at this hotel again. It is a shame, as so much of the hotel has good things to offer."

We had coupons as we had booked on a tour and the breakfast included a full American Breakfast. i asked for egg sausage and bacon but was told i could not have two meats ! My wife only wanted fruit but she could not have it as an option to the full American breakfast even though it was less expensive. In the end she ordered an egg with toast from the full American Breakfast then as an idea and I asked her to order sausages which Iate with my bacon !

I welcomed the quick check-in, great location, large room, and efficient service. My room was nice, but by no means cheap. Overall, I was impressed, until breakfast, that is. The hotel serves an appalling &quot;continental&quot; breakfast. I was staying in a lovely room in what I thought was a smart hotel, yet when it came to breakfast about 40 guests were cramped into a windowless room which served the most awful pastries I have ever had (a colleague verified this!), with not enough seats and terrible plastic plates and cups, yuk, what a shame. I would probably try one of the other hotels on the same street next time, or if I stay in the San Carlos I'd skip breakfast. I think management should review the breakfast situtation as it is so poor I do not think offering it does the hotel any favours."

Nice gym and although i didnt use it, think theyve upgraded the Spa ( see other reviews re ladies of the night). 4. Good choice of food for breakfast although not in same class as Shangri la regarding food quality.5. 2pm checkoutDidnt like:1. Staff on exec floor nice enough but pretty useless regarding restaurant recommendations for dinner2. Location not the best. Need a taxi to get anywhere really.3. Lot of western (american ) travel groups at breakfast. Not the place for a quiet breakfast !"

The hotel itself is basic but the location is superb. You are within walking distance to a number of the main attractions in New York and for all the others the subway is just a few blocks away. We had in a spacious double room which was very clean, the bathroom facilities were excellent and the beds extremely comfortable. We were also surprised to find that our room was equipped with a plasma tv! You may be told that breakfast is provided by the hotel but we soon realised on our first day that the breakfast room was actually the small reception area and the hotel staff pop out to buy a few muffins and cartons of orange juice. For a few dollars you can walk a couple of blocks to the Murray Hill Diner and have a proper american sized breakfast. This hotel was on the expensive side, but I would recommend it to others without any hesitation."

The buffett breakfast was outstanding, just be careful if you book their bed and breakfast rate with breakfast included in the price of the room that they do not accidentely charge it onto your bill.

Another good point... there is a public internet laptop in the check in area which works well, and WiFi. A bid downer for us was the water is lukewarm at best and management stated the owner likes it that way to save burns. I think it is more likely it is lukewarm to save the owner money. The continental breakfast is juice, coffee, apples and a few bananas, and pastries in plastic. There is no common area so breakfast is eaten in your room. Fortunately there are several restaurants open for breakfast within walking distance. Since the motel is on Lombard St. there is a lot of traffic noise during the day. It cuts down at night, but even with &quot;upgraded&quot; windows it still sounds like the ocean is outside your room"

Rooms were elegant beyond expectations wih a full kitchenette, a jacuzzi tub, and a room half again the size of any other in Vegas.. It was one block east of the strip and it was not a smoky casino downstairs. The Fashion Show mall is across the street south. It does not open until 10:00 so you are a captive to the hotel for Breakfast. You can have a buffet breakfast which is delicious but very expensive $62 with tax and tip) or you can but something ahead of time somewhere else and store in your kitchenette. The restraunt does serve excellent food and we splurged for breakfast and ate smaller meals during the day. I look for elegance and value and this hotel gave the best of both. The bed was really great for this 60 year old body. Try it, you'll like it!"

Very unfortunate that breakfast and coffee in the room is not included or affordably convenient. PRET Marble Arch offered the best food and value but was a 15 minute walk. Doesn't help when you want your morning coffee and to get it at the hotel blows your whole breakfast budget At $225 a night one should not have to expect to pay 21 pounds (thats about $42 US) each for breakfast. Ice, pillows etc available but required room service (and yet more tip money for basic needs)Concierge was excellent, very accomodating, and helpful.

When checking in we were told the continental breakfast was free, but the hot breakfast was not. I had eggs and coffee, my wife had a bagel and coffee. We were charged $14 for hot breakfast and $10 for continental. I complained to manager at checkout and he said &quot;I find it hard to believe that you were told the continental breakfast was free.&quot; I asked if he found it easier to believe that I was lying... he then said &quot;you consumed the breakfast, you have to pay for the breakfast.&quot; To avoid a fight I just paid, but will never stay there again.

We ordered our breakfast in our room every morning and it always arrived on time and was good. The food and drinks are extremely expensive at the Palace. I was glad we had a package including breakfast, otherwise 2 breakfasts would have cost over $100. Everyone at the hotel was extremely helpful and very, very nice. They have a well trained staff. The hotel is in a wonderful location. Our room was nicely decorated and had a big flat screen tv (probably 42 inches). The beds were very comfortable. We also ate dinner at Gilt one night (the hotel's restaurant). It was very good. They were able to fit us in at the last minute, and still got us out in time for our play. I was exceptionally happy with our stay at the Palace and will definitely go back in the future."

Next room had a bathroom exhaust fan that never stopped running, and it was LOUD. So we asked for maintenance this time rather than move. Five hours later, still no maintenance! Called again and someone came immediately and solved the problem by stuffing a towel in it, which did quiet it down. So, the manager gave us 2 comp breakfasts. Well, that just made things worse. The breakfast was ICE cold, we sent it back, and it came back still cold. So we decided to skip breakfast that day. What a shame, because the hotel is clean, staff is nice, good location. At first I really thought we finally found our favorite hotel (we are always looking in NY). Maybe next trip."

Seating in breakfast room was available although it was early when we got there. Enjoyed the location so much, right by the Empire State, Macy's etc. We walked everywhere! Held our bags for us on last day when we did the last minute bits of shopping. It is not a luxurious hotel by any means but was perfect for someone who doesnt spend much time in the hotel. There was a bit of noise late at night on one night particulary - we were only on the 5th floor - its probably better to have a higher floor although you will wait an age for the lift.. over all would visit again for location...."

Second, location-- while you're close to the Olympic village, Bird's Nest, Water Cube, International Convention Center, you're far from the city's action and historical sites (minimum 15 minute ride). Moreover, 9 of 10 taxis did not know the location so you'll have to get a quick grasp of direction if you stay here. Note that it is near the McDonald's on Minzuyuan Road. It's a 5-minute-walk to the main road to hail a cab, or you can have the hotel call one for you for 3RMB extra. I also heard there's a subway station nearby but did not have an opportunity to use it."

I was very impressed with everyone from the front desk to the server's at breakfast. Everyone was extremely friendly and always willing to help.

Exceptional value. Rooms modern and fairly spacious with quality linens and towels. Free wi-fi in room. W 28th St is mainly filled with flower shops and the like but an ok area. Despite my Mother being in her late 70's it was not too far to walk to Times Square (in the rain!!!!).

The 12th floor breakfast (included) was on the caliber of a $25-30 buffet every morning per person! It had a beautiful presentation including breakfast meats, fruit, egg dishes, pastries, hot breakfast entrees, as well as all the usual continental fare. The service and quality were like an impeccable club. Dinner recommendations were great from the doorman. It felt like a very luxury experience for a VERY reasonable price by downtown San Francisco standards. Don't pass this one by! The Marine Memorial displays are tasteful and very interesting, but not overpowering--worth the history while staying in a great place."

We had a free night through out bank at the hotel. We had some reservations trouble while checking in, however the desk agent worked hard and was able to help us and comp'd breakfast the next morning, which we were very appreciative of. The hotel is in a great location, near the subway and not too far from many attractions. As stated in previous reviews, the rooms are pretty small, but they are suffiicent. The flatscreen TV was nice and I couldn't hear anything in the hallways (the stereotypical NYC sirens however I could hear). The breakfast (a $25/person value) was a joke. I get free breakfasts at Holiday Inn Express' that are similar. But it was free, so I do not complain. Parking at the ramp next door was not too expensive and overall we had a great say in Manhattan and would stay again."

They serve continental breakfast and this is a plus because it is hard to find breakfast included in NYC. Breakfast is not served in the hotel but in Brendan's a kind of Irish Pub/Restaurant but you do not have to go out of the hotel because there's a comunicating door between the hotel and the pub. Room was basic but clean and big enough, bathroom was also clean and nice but a bit narrow. There was just a strange (humidity I supose) stain on the ceiling.35th street can be a bit noisy at night so try to get a room in top floors. Staff is very helpfull and kind.

The waffles, cereal, bagels, English muffins, hard boiled eggs, and banana nut muffins were very satisfying. Fruit, coffee and juice were also included. We would recommend this hotel to anyone."

What a deal! My room was clean, comfortable and not a bad size for a hotel in the middle of Manhattan. HD TV with a large selection of cable channels was a nice touch. Free wi-fi in each room. Staff was friendly and helpful, especially when i needed extra coffee packets deliviered to the room. Free breakfast in the morning is a huge plus. The breakfast room had all the basics - omlettes, hot and cold cereal, coffee, bagels, muffins, donuts, fresh fruits, yogurt and more. My room had a view of both Macy's and the Empire State Building. Subway entrance is literally steps away from the front door. My one and only (minor) complaint was slow elevator service. Only 2 elevators serving a 20-story hotel is inadequate. That being said, it was perfect for a one-night stay."

This hotel is still new, only about 3 years old, and is in very good condition. My husband and I stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday, and even at such a busy time the pool was empty and the breakfast room always had seats available. This seems like a small thing to be grateful for, but majority of the times I stay at a hotel with free breakfast the room is so crowded that there is no place to eat, and I often skip it altogether. My extended family stayed at the Flamingo, and for the same nightly rate I got free internet and free breakfast without having to walk through a smoky casino, so I think I got the better deal."

The bed was very comfortable and there was coffee/tea making facilities provided in the room. We had a complimentary self service breakfast and this included cereals, toast, cheese, doughnuts, fresh fruit, yoghurts, tea, coffee and orange juice. You could eat as much as you liked. The breakfast room could have been bigger as it was always very busy. We always managed to be seated, but some guests took their breakfast to their room. The hotel was very central for getting about and we would certainly recommend it for staying in the Mid -Town area of New York."

The front desk employee offered us the laundry room to leave our luggage in order to take a walk in San Francisco. When we returned at 6pm after visiting Alcatraz jail, the room was ready. Not too big, but it had a king size, hot water, hairdryer, a TV. It was enough for us. The &quot;breakfast&quot; is very funny , you take the breakfast in the front desk area, next to the guests who are checking in or out. You only have coffee or tea and a few muffins. You take the breakfast stood up, no chairs, no table, nothing. However, the hotel is well ubicated. We took a tour and the tour bus passed through Lombard Street, we just went down in front of our hotel. Next to Lombard Street, it is Chestnut Ave. with a lot of restaurantes, cafes and shops."

Service could not be better. e.g.---I called from the lobby for ice to be sent to my room. By the time I got up to my room on the 33rd floor, the ice was there. The amenities were quite perfect. The Istana for breakfast, the bar in the late evening, the front desk, the houskeepers,the concierge desk---were all eager to please and I hope to return to the Palace again. It was my first stay. No matter where I was in the hotel, all employees seemed to stop and say &quot;Hello and can I help you? &quot; The training of staff must be a huge task......and successful. I was able to get a good rate including breakfast for a 4 day weekend by calling the hotel directly. Our daily breakfast would have been quite costly (in my standards) if we had not had a package...."

Very quiet!! 5.Complimentary continental breakfast was plentiful and fresh. 6. Shower water was piping hot and pressure was strong. 7.24/hr. coffee/tea in breakfast room. 8. Staff was friendly and accomodating. 9.They are happy to store your bags after you check out. Negatives: 1.Rooms were just a bit in need of sprucing up. 2.Breakfast room is tiny, just 4 tables, so most people had to haul food back to the room. 3.immediate environs just a bit seedy, but fine a couple of blocks over. 4.no lobby to speak of, just reception desk. 5. We were there last week, one of the peak travel periods, so it was grossly overpriced. Staff told me it is half of that in low season. Would definitely go back in low season, as it would be an excellent value then."

Hotel staff speak some English and are eager to help but beware of the texi driver. Make sure they turn on the meter. The down side is room is small and carpet is worn out. Expensive internet. No freebee here. Breakfast is $35US per person. Great breakfast with Chinese and Western choices. If you do not care for the big breakfast , you can buy cheaper breakfast right at the mall (one escaletor down from the hotel basement ) food level. Very safe hotel. Wonderful pool and great work out area. Hotel restaurants are very expensive even for North American standard."

There is even coffee available 24 hours in the lobby area. The rooms were ok. Our's was on the 12th floor and a little pokey and 1980's but lets face it you're hardly in the room at all. The staff were ok, cannot say much about them as had little contact. . My only warning to you is watch out at breakfast time. Peak breakfast time was about 8-9am and there were not enough chairs, people were standing to eat their crunchy nuts - bizzare! We were there at peak time - Easter, but still. In fairness though, a clean and well run hotel. All in all pretty much what you would expect for your money. The city itself however! Fantastic.... Book Up!! Happy Holidays."

Very unfortunate that breakfast and coffee in the room is not included or affordably convenient. PRET Marble Arch offered the best food and value but was a 15 minute walk. Doesn't help when you want your morning coffee and to get it at the hotel blows your whole breakfast budget At $225 a night one should not have to expect to pay 21 pounds (thats about $42 US) each for breakfast. Ice, pillows etc available but required room service (and yet more tip money for basic needs)Concierge was excellent, very accomodating, and helpful.

But it is got location, location, location - on 45th West between fifth avenue and avenue of the americas with central park a ten minute walk away, and radio city and the rockefeller centre a few minutes on foot too. Grand central station is a couple of blocks away and the excellent italian restaurant Resette is just next door. The rooms have free wireless internet access and a huge range of cable channels, but they are very small. USA Today is free every morning. The breakfast room is chaotic at peak times with too many people trying to crowd into a very small space. But hot breakfast was included in the rate so I was not complaining. The staff were friendly - Jasmine on reception had a very cheery, positive attitude when I checked in at midnight after 15 hours on a plane. So all in all a good experience"

I usually skip the breakfast, as 7.50 GBP is a lot for breakfast. This location is excellent. A short walk from Tube stations (Westminster or Waterloo) and close to major tourist sights. There is a small Marks &amp; Spence inside the Waterloo train station for basic food items, e.g. breakfast bagel. Try Ned's Noodle Box directly across the street for a tasty meal at about 7 GBP.My one gripe is the early morning noise of trash collection in the enclosed court below most windows. This occurs about 7 AM, just when you are getting some non-jet-lag sleep."

We ordered our breakfast in our room every morning and it always arrived on time and was good. The food and drinks are extremely expensive at the Palace. I was glad we had a package including breakfast, otherwise 2 breakfasts would have cost over $100. Everyone at the hotel was extremely helpful and very, very nice. They have a well trained staff. The hotel is in a wonderful location. Our room was nicely decorated and had a big flat screen tv (probably 42 inches). The beds were very comfortable. We also ate dinner at Gilt one night (the hotel's restaurant). It was very good. They were able to fit us in at the last minute, and still got us out in time for our play. I was exceptionally happy with our stay at the Palace and will definitely go back in the future."

The rooms were great. The beds, pillows, sheets, huge towels, free shoeshines and really awesome shower just made it even better. Their breakfast which was included in our rate was called a continental breakfast but was a full breakfast with choice of eggs, bacon and the most delicious pastries and croissants. I have stayed in other 5 star hotels and this is up there with the best. The location in Old Montreal was also good, near lots of restaurants and shops."

A bit embarrasing and ended up paying again for the kids. I went through the booking process again to see if I had missed some small print but no, no mention of anything at all. It seems if you can't gamble, you can't have the food !! We were in a room on the swimming pool level. Rooms were fine, just an awful view of the multi-storey car park. To give room its due, the triple glazing meant there was no noise from the cars. Overall though, came away feeling I had the wool pulled over my eyes and had been ripped off. Not a good feeling."

The Rooms are adequate, but have no coffee making facility and the smallest bathroom that has ever been designed. Breakfast was a joke. We had coupons as we had booked on a tour and the breakfast included a full American Breakfast. i asked for egg sausage and bacon but was told i could not have two meats ! My wife only wanted fruit but she could not have it as an option to the full American breakfast even though it was less expensive. In the end she ordered an egg with toast from the full American Breakfast then as an idea and I asked her to order sausages which Iate with my bacon !

Fresh bed linen and towels supplied every day. Coffee maker in the room and was replenished daily. Hotel was very warm which was great as it was quite cold outside. Complimentary breakfast (7am to 10am) was great and whenever the breakfastroom was full we took our breakfast back to our room. Reception staff were more than helpful and very friendly. Hotel location is excellent for shoppers as its only about a 5 minute walk to Macys and Manhattan Mall. Penn Station is 2 blocks (400 yards). The Empire State Building is 100 yards away and its a 10 minute walk to Times Square. Very centrally located indeed. Do try the food at O'Reillys, 54 W 31street and Ellens Stardust Diner on Broadway is well worth a visit. Will definately stay at the Red Roof Inn again."

I called and immediately someone was sent up to replace the batteries. At another time, the tv remote was not working and immediately after calling, a service personnel came up to check on it for me. Great buffet breakfast every morning! Furthermore the hotel was at a fabulous location, right next to shopping and eating area. 10 mins walk to forbidden city and tiananmen square."

Out of 10 visits to NYC over the years we have never had a nicer hotel. The room was clean and quiet (we were on the 10th floor and facing 26 St and not Park Ave.). Te breakfast buffet in the morning only had a limited selection of items but we still enjoyed having breakfast in the lobby with several free NYC newpapers to read. The staff was very friendly. They did us a fvor also--we arrived at 8AM in the morning from a redeye flight from San Francisco. Our reservation was for the evening of our arrival, We planned just to drop off our bags and then return at 3 or so to check-in. However, there was an empty room available and they let us check in at 8AM and gave us the room and breakfast. I was really pleased with that. This will be my hotel of choice in NYC in the future."

This time the price was higher as I did not enjoy the special pricing of the holidays. More importantly breakfast was not included. The breakfast bufffet is good but the price is outragious. This is by far the most I have paid for breakfast in China. The cost was 340rmb for 2. This is how much I paid for a room at the Crowne Plaza (nicer hotel) including 2 breakfasts a few days later in Changsha!!! If you must stay at this hotel, cross the street and go to Starbucks."

The bed was sooooo comfortable and the large windows let in a lot of natural light. The only downside is that the hotel is very minimal and there were no extras in the room like tea/coffee making. The breakfast buffet which was included in the rate was ok but no hot food and some of the choices were a bit odd for breakfast. I asked for scrambled eggs and bacon and when it came it was inedible and when challenged he only replaced the scrambled eggs and the bacon was then cold! I then found out that I had to pay 14 CAN $ for this breakfast! However, overall this is a fantastic hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful. It is also in a marvellous location for sightseeing."

Location perfect for going around town, nice restaurants in the neighbourhood (e.g. Tabla at Madison Sq. Park, or the Mexican restaurant next door). Room was beautiful, big for NY standards, nice king-size bed and nicely decorated, windows can be opened, A/C did not make too much noise. Also free wifi in the room. Our room was opposite the elevator, but doors are &quot;soundproof&quot;, did not hear a thing. Complimentary breakfast was very good, nice coffee! Only thing about the breakfast: there are not many tables, and because it is so nice to sit there with a newspaper or your laptop, people tend to have breakfast longer than usual, you have to find the right time to go down... They serve wine and a small thing to eat during weekdays around 5 p.m., very nice when you come back from work or shopping/sightseeing! Employees were all very friendly and relaxed. Hope to come back next time when in NY!"

I spread rose pedals all over the room, ran a hot bubble bath, and lit a couple of candles. The night was great and I scored extra points with my boyfriend (LOL).The breakfast also offered FREE breakfast every morning from 6-10:30am.....which I given a tray so I can give my love breakfast-in-bed. Since I live in the local NYC area, I was able to call my friends for FREE and internet was also FREE. Staff was friendly, hotel was clean and I was able to check-in before 3pm.

Cost was approximately US$100. Great breakfast, great room (big and clean) and great service from the staff. When I first checked in, the safe in the room was out of battery. I called and immediately someone was sent up to replace the batteries. At another time, the tv remote was not working and immediately after calling, a service personnel came up to check on it for me. Great buffet breakfast every morning! Furthermore the hotel was at a fabulous location, right next to shopping and eating area. 10 mins walk to forbidden city and tiananmen square."

We were able to walk to most venues including Broadway shows. Those further away were accessible via the hop on/hop off bus which also was within walking distance. We were told to get breakfast at nearby cafe's, but the hotel breakfast was not much dearer and much more convenient. Was of good quality and many choices.

Unfortunately, the hotel has not been refreshed in quite a while and is beginning to show its age. Elevators are looking beat up as are the hallways and room furnishings. Breakfast was tasty although the breakfast service is seriously understaffed. The nice young lady tried her best to keep up with replenishing the eggs, juice, coffee etc. but it was just too much for one person to do. As a result, there were times when certain breakfast items were missing. Overall this hotel is fine and the staff are competent but it could certainly use a sprucing up. If you like beige and beige and beige, you'll find this place soothing. But if a little color were added to the wallpaper, paint and furnishings, the place would be much more appealing. If you get a good deal or using points, this hotel will do the trick. Otherwise, I would stay elsewhere."

It is a new hotel and its rooms are decorated to a very high standard. The beds were very comfortable, plenty of space in room with two Queen beds, bathroom large with gowns and all toiletries supplied. We opted for breakfast included and we were not disappointed. They had an excellent choice of continental breakfast and hot breakfasts if you were prepared to pay extra. Tip: check their online rates daily as they change daily. If you ask for an exterior room, street view, then be prepared for some noise from the street. There are great French restaurants (mostly serving americanised good food) just across the road and there is a National/Alamo car rental shop just two blocks further up Bush Street. Overall, would highly recommend this hotel."

The rooms and premises were very clean and the staff were knowledgeable and friendly. The rooms were quite small but adequate. My only complaint would be regarding the breakfast room. The inn was filled near capacity and the breakfast room, which is tiny, was always packed. As a result we had to either eat in the pub or bring a tray back to our room. Also, the breakfast itself was only &quot;continental&quot;, as opposed to a fully-prepared meal, which I gather is the concept of a B'n B. The price of the rooms was reasonable and the location is in close proximity to several San Francisco attractions. If we were to do a &quot;budget&quot; trip to this city again, we would stay here."

I can't believe I would say that about a Holiday Inn, but this is the first time I've stayed in a HI Express, and I was very impressed. I've travelled quite a lot in the past year, and this was the newest, cleanest and most comfortable room that I've had, no questions. This hotel is still new, only about 3 years old, and is in very good condition. My husband and I stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday, and even at such a busy time the pool was empty and the breakfast room always had seats available. This seems like a small thing to be grateful for, but majority of the times I stay at a hotel with free breakfast the room is so crowded that there is no place to eat, and I often skip it altogether. My extended family stayed at the Flamingo, and for the same nightly rate I got free internet and free breakfast without having to walk through a smoky casino, so I think I got the better deal."

My phone was not working, I tried to explain the problem at the reception but gave up after some minuts. For the price I got on internet and considering it is in Shanghai, maybe ok but next time, I will try an other hotel. Breakfast cost about 100 RMB.

I really did not spend a lot of time in the room as I was either on conference, walking the &quot;Mile&quot; or oogling over what I wanted to buy in the Apple Store - love that place. I had 3 breakfasts there, but no lunches or dinners. The breakfast buffet was lovely - but it is pretty hard to screw up a breakfast buffet. I did not use the bar, the pool or the fitness facilities. I can tell you that the room was excellent, I loved the location and the service could not have been better - very helpful, polite and competent. The rate I got (from the University) was a steal - $189 per night. I have no idea what the regular rate is though. Hope this helps."

When you go down to reception in the morning you are given breakfast vouchers and directions to a restaurant. We had expected a continental buffet breakfast, what we got was &quot;help yourself&quot; vacuum flasks of hot water and coffee (various teabags also provided) and a plate each with one slice of toast cut diagonally into two and a warm crumpet. Butter and pots of jam are on the table. My partner is diabetic, so we had to purchase extra food, as this was not enough for him. This arrangement seems quite new, so it could be teething problems, but the restaurant service was very slow, so bear that in mind, if you have business meetings to attend. Hotel room was clean, although the floors in rooms and corridors are laminate, which produce a lot of extra noise that carpets would have deadened."

First, I was concerned about the amenities, given that the hotel offers &quot;services apartments&quot;, but they provided towels, soap, shower gel, linens...etc. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The bed is a sofabed so if you go there, be aware of it. The only drawback was that they forgot to give me pillows for which I ended up searching the whole studio (but I was given some immediately). Last time I stayed at The Royal Horseguards, certainly in another sphere of hotels, but I liked the Citadines as well and it is cheaper. The location is unbeatable, you can practically see Trafalgar Square. The breakfast is overpriced, so if you care for English breakfast, exit the hotel, cross the road, turn into Great Scotland Yard, and right at the corner of Whithall is a pub offering breakfast."

I had the original documentatioon from travelzoo so after approximately 5 minutes we were provided with the breakfast coupons. The location is very good, we are frequent travelers to Montreal and the hotel is close to everything downtown and the metro. Rooms were fine, a bit dated but clean and the housekeeping staff assigned to our room usually had our room cleaned by early afternoon. The buffet breakfast was good with a selection of hot and cold items but was a bit expensive $20 if it was not included with your room rate."

The three of us fit comfortably in a room with 2 double beds. I would stay there again! For breakfast, be sure to try the Morning Star Cafe for breakfast - right on the corner at 57th and 9th. We also ate breakfast one morning at the Brooklyn Diner, which was a little pricey, but very good. Dinner options:- Ate at O'Neal's (49 W 64th Street) before the theater one night - very good upscale American food; moderately expensive- Also tried Patsy's (236 W 56th Street) - great Italian food, so-so service and high prices!"

When getting to the hotel I found out there were no breakfasts and there hadn't been for 2 months (with the supplying kitchen closed) - total 5$ / night was removed from the bill (a token for two people and the inconvenience). They had not change their listings with the trourist office in this time and I would not have booked there if there was not some breakfast, a basic expectation for small Montreal hotels and B&amp;Bs. The restaurent beside the hotel opens late and closes early. Otherwise desk help was friendly. Parking is 12$ per night in a garage near the hotel - OKThere is great value in Montreal in 2 and 3 stars not to have surprises"

I was one of the few Americans here, with Europeans making up the majority of guests. Breakfast was typical BW continental style.

Having a car in San Fran makes the world of difference - our previous trips we were reliant on taxis and walking - which was not so bad but to get off the beaten track and see some amazing parts of SF def get a car!The hotel concierge team were great at ensuring we had maps and info. The breakfasts were fine for the included price and they always took great care of our 3 year old. The only complaint we had was the room next door was full of College students who decided to party from 1am until 6am - not great for us at all. Told the hotel who offered us free breakfast but that did not mean much to us as we were already having breakfasts included. All in all I would recommend this hotel to all sorts of groups!"

The rooms are very large (we had booked a Landmark room) only the furniture is a bit too old fashioned for my taste. Internet is for free. The hotel is in walking distance to the Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, Oriental plaza shopping centre and 5 minutes by taxi (costs approx. 20 CNY=2 Euros) to the silk market. The concierge is very helpful and efficient. The (breakfast) restaurant manager Mrs. Guedes is also very nice. She supervises the breakfast service, asks the guests what they are up to for the day and makes you feel comfy at Raffles. The breakfast buffet was yummy and catered for Western and Chinese taste. Only the coffee was not really good. We definitely would go back to Raffles if we travel to Beijing a second time."

I was given a corner room that was large, light and airy. Breakfast was excellent with fresh fruit, pastries and cereal each morning. Breakfast was not included and at CAD 275 a night, I think it should have been. Internet access is also not free but at CAD 16 for a 24 hour period it is livable with. Le Meridien is about a 20 minute walk from the downtown area (where my client was), but the walk was a nice way to start the day on a morning. Overall a comfortable hotel - please think about including breakfast and internet in the rates though. Michael"

Very impressed with the small things too like International Power Plugs as standard!The renovations down stairs were still on and that also affected the Gym setting.

I like a good breakfast before a long day of walking and exploring. The buffet offers fresh fruit, a mixture of Western and local breakfast dishes, and a helpful wait staff. The omelet station is excellent. The location of the hotel is great. It is close to a subway stop, Tian'an Men Square, Forbidden City, and lots of shopping and restaurants."

The owners were very friendly and the place was very clean but the room was TINY and cramped with hardly any storage space. I think you can get a bigger room if you make enough fuss but when we were there the motel was full up so there was no chance to change room. The location of the motel is excellent however. I would recommend the motel but only if you do not want to spend very long in your room. Breakfast was included but this was just a couple of buns/cakes that you had to eat on your way out as there is nowhere to sit and eat the food! We were not even informed what time the breakfast ran from/until and so often we missed out on breakfast. Good but do not expect too much."

It is slap bang in the middle of Manhattan, very close to the Empire State Bld (I could see it from my hotel room window). My room was not very big, but clean and I loved the free wireless internet. The room heating could have been better: either it blows hot air or it is off. But this seems to be a general problem for the US, I noticed. Although the hotel is in the middle of the city that never sleeps, my room was incredibly quiet, so I could sleep very well. The room had a safe that was big enough to hold my 12 inch powerbook, camera etc. Breakfast was included, which is increasingly rare. The breakfast room could have been bigger, but breakfast itself was quite adequate, with coffee, tea, juices, bagels, toast, cheese etc. Next time I go to NYC I will certainly stay here again."

As others have stated, Hotel QT is in a great location. 1 minute from Times Square, a few blocks from Rockefeller Center, and subway entrances. The hotel itself was very modern and well appointed. Our bed was very comfortable and while the room was small, we did not feel that we lacked any space. Storage was available under the raised bed which also helped. The hotel also provided free continental breakfast which was great to take advantage of. If you're looking for a more hearty breakfast, Cafe Europa is around the corner from the hotel and they have good breakfast items at cheap prices. The only complaint of the whole trip was that the pool was closed for maintenance. This did not stop us from enjoying the rest of the hotel and our stay. We would definately stay here again."

Exceptional value. Rooms modern and fairly spacious with quality linens and towels. Free wi-fi in room. W 28th St is mainly filled with flower shops and the like but an ok area. Despite my Mother being in her late 70's it was not too far to walk to Times Square (in the rain!!!!). Staff at the hotel couldn't have been more helpful and the breakfast was excellent - freshly cooked to order and with good selection. Highly recommended."

You can walk to some great markets and the Government Handicraft store is nearby. The grounds are beautiful.

In addition the room was quite small. Went back to the front desk and inquired about a quieter room and was told nothing was available since the hotel was under construction. Ultimately we were offered an upgrade to a quiet, larger room for $50 plus tax. He could tell we were unsure so he offered to throw in breakfast. The new room was quiet although hardly larger. Breakfast the following morning consisted of coffee, some pieces of fruit, a few croissants and some cold cereal in the concierge lounge. The gentleman in charge there was extremely rude. At exactly 10:00 he proceeded to kick everybody out, even those who were still eating their breakfast. We ended up grabbing a banana and a cup of coffee on our way out. Overall it was ok, but hardly worth the $200/night we ended up paying."

Booked a jr suite and all were filled when we arrived and were upgraded to a king suite. After reading recent reviews before our trip, I did not think we would have the breakfast, but were given vouchers for each day. Breakfast was very good, not the normal continental breakfast. Hot eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit, bagels, muffins etc. All the employees treated us very well. Our room was large and very quiet, never heard a siren or the early morning trash trucks. Close to subways and an easy walk to many sites. Saw 'the rat' the morning we left. From the reviews, I was not sure what it was all about. Something to do with a labor union. This was my second trip to NYC and would definitely stay at the Avalon again."

We loved the suite-it was huge, but did have that old musty smell that other postings spoke about. The breakfast was o.k., and so was the service. I also wish they would have told me that the parking package didnt include all that it said on the website, e.g.-that evening drinks and snacks are not included, since the bar and restaurant are being renovated. Although they did manage to provide breakfast. But, all in all we loved the charm and ambience of this old world hotel."

But waiters/waitress, captains, managers were trying to do their best. Reason there are so many people staying in Hilton is they have a special price of RMB678 (each day) which is abt US$87 for local Chinese including breakfast for two during the Labor Day Golden Week Holiday. My price is US$295 per person including Dragon Air Hong Kong to Shanghai return and 3 nights in Hilton(on twin share basis) with daily breakfast. So it is a good deal"

We booked it based on the good reviews we read on trip advisor. The room was basic and and noise from traffic was loud when the windows were open, which was needed as there is no air-con. The parking is free and there is a contintental breakfast included. However the breakfast was served in the reception area which is small and so breakfast resembled a rugby scrum with everyone trying to get to their bagels &amp; muffins. The motel is located in a rough area and we did not feel very safe walking in the area at night. If I had paid a cheaper rate I might have been more satisfied but $160 a night was poor value"

A great surprise was the closeness to the South Point Casino. Just a close walk across the side street, and we did that often. The pool was great, and warm. We mixed our own cocktails and small lunch and sat by the pool to enjoy. Parking was never a problem. We had a unit overlooking the pool on the back side of Sage. We always found a spot in the back making it very convenient to enter to our room. The grounds were very clean, as was the building. After the congestion and noise of &quot;the Strip&quot; it was so welcoming to return to the peace and quiet of the Grandview."

Only thing I can say is that I kept hearing a very faint thud thud thud all day and night - I think it was from the elevator. But we werent right near it. We tried Planet Dailies, Yolos and also the spice market buffet during our stay and it was great food at all 3 places. We loved Yolos the most. We also used the pool and hot tub. They were both nice and they also had drink service at the pool only complaint was that it was slow... I think since only 1 gal was working the pool area it seemed and it was verrry hot! We really liked the location and it was nice to just roam the shops at Miracle Miles rather than go out in the heat during the day. Nice choice of shops too. We would surley stay at PH again if we're in Vegas."

Needless to say I had no fun at all. Plus the check out person was really unprofessional and I had to report her. The manager was responsive though. I had one of my worst vacations in a 5 star hotel. The service we received was definitely not even 1 star. I would never go there again."

Attention to detail is consistent. Starbucks coffee in room, robes in room. Free bottled water in room. Evening turndown service. Umbrellas at poolside. Showers by poolside have hot and cold water. Pool is actually open till 2Am. Unheard of in the other hotels. From entrance of hotel to strip is about the same time you would spend getting from the entrance of the bigger hotels to your room. NO Kidding. Nearby convenience store has deli and food inexpensive. It is convient to everything. Approximately $12 to airport from hotel. Near Bally's and Bellagio. I've stayed at Venetian and Hilton. The service at the Westin was way superior. I think because its smaller you can get personal attention. I highly recommend this hotel."

The first night the patio plastic furniture was in the freezing cold and dirty pool, allow with many porn newspaper flyers. The maintenance did clean out the furniture and paper the next day, but left the dead bird in the pool. My husband got the net and retrieved the bird to throw it away. The room needed new carpeting, as many stains were all over and was worn through in spots. This is a not so cheap motel, as we spent $69 Thurs. $ 125 Fri. and $125 Sat. All other motels were full and with the cancellation policy, we were pretty much stuck. The location is great, but boy do not plan on spending anytime here.

Beds are small, I think they are full-size. Carpets were in need of a shampooing. Very dirty and stained. Pool area is nice but, beware of peeling paint on the bottom of the pool. My daughter had dove into the pool to grab a toy from the bottom and had a paint chip wedged under her finger nail. We had to mention this to the desk people twice and no one seemed to want to report it to management. Another thing about the pool area, make sure you have your room key or you will be acosted by the desk clerk/lifeguard. If you have children under the age of 18, they are not permitted to use the new workout room. If we had been aware of that fact we would have picked another hotel, that information is not listed on the website (that I could find). Our children are in their teens and were not allowed to use the facilites."

The lobby was expansive and accomodating, the service was excellent, the pool was great, and the breakfast was perfect. I did have one complaint... my room was &quot;non-smoking,&quot; however, it was clear that this room was probably &quot;smoking&quot; at one point in time, and the &quot;stink&quot; was still there. It needed either a cleansing or a replacement of carpet/paint to eliminate the odor. The breakfast buffet was one of the most expansive and will presented I've ever experienced! I'm not crazy about pools that are over 6' deep in the main section (you can't walk!) but overall it was not that bad. I did not bring my kid, but the kids pool was fantastic, and included play structures. Mine would have loved it. The &quot;action&quot; is in Jemeriah, and this hotel is not in that area. However, the cab ride is only about $10 from here, making it a non-issue."

But the hotel was great, nice room, nice staff, great service, good location..... I also found really good to have free wifi in the room. Gym was one of the biggest I've seen in a hotel. The only disadvantage is that as mentioned in other reviews, this hotel should have a pool designated for adults only. The hotel has 3 pools and the first two days we were fine, but then the last 3 days all 3 pools were invaded by children. Please do not get me wrong, there are children that behave very well and there are adults that behave worse than children, but if you're travelling without children you would prefer to stay away form them :) So the hotel's 3 pools &amp; gardens are big enough to get a designated area for adults. Anyway I would go back to this hotel, and I strongly recommend it."

We loved our room--the beds were VERY comfortable--the best hotel bed I ever slept on, with cozy bedding. The carpets and wallpaper showed some wear in our room, however. The bathrooms were large; the water pressure under the rain-shower and the whirlpool were wonderful. Very enjoyable to use. Amenities in the bathroom were nice. Overall, it was very quiet and relaxing. The hotel was clean, well vacuumed, and smelled fresh. The pool was also refreshing; the water temperature just right. The poolside restaurant offered great sandwiches and drinks. Walkways outside were enjoyable, with palm trees, flowers, and water areas with small waterfalls. Almost all staff were attentive and hospitable. The restaurants and casino were great!Because the resort is so large, I think it needed more directional signs, even though a resort map is provided."

The pool was great, because there were so few families there. The water was warm and there were not lots of out of control children screaming and taking over the pool. It was quiet and the girls had the pool to themselves. They did not want to leave it! The rooms are small but we had a great view of the city. The girls also loved the bath products.

I got the non-smoking 2 queen bed room as I had requested. The room was clean but I did not think it had enough lights. It's ok in the daytime if you have your curtains open but if you do not, it seems like even if you turn on every single light, it is still not bright enough. We went to the pool for a few hours and it was quite nice. The water was cold but the pool area was clean and they had lots of chairs for people to use. The drinks from the bar in the pool area were really good... but I thought they were kind of expensive!It was my first time in Vegas so I loved the location - very central so it was not a long walk in either direction. I also got a super deal so I thought the value was great... I paid less than what I would have if I went to a 3 star hotel!"

Didnt stay long at the pool, went to dinner at the Mexican place, not bad. I think the coolest thing was the Friday night happy hour from 5-10. The place was packed, sat withsome great locals and geat time. Next day the wind died down was able to relax at pool, I will say that the pool is not heated so beware when jumping in. If you are looking for lots of young woman this not for you. Lots of familes with young ones. Alll and all this place is great vaule if you dont mind being a way from the strip.

We are all between the ages of 18-22 and the atmosphere was so relaxing and just fun. We got there at 2 in the morning on Thursday Morning and Left Sunday at Noon. From the moment we stepped into the hotel we all fell in love with it. Well the guys mostly fell in Love with the Hooter's girls. The rooms were VERY nice and oh gosh the beds are perfect!! My boyfriend wants to buy that kind of bed now. The price was great, we booked at the perfect time. We got 2 rooms for 4 nights for $ 400 all together. The swimming pool was perfect, and it had a little like camp fire pits around the pool which was great at night. The pool was heated also. I heard a lot of bad reviews about this hotel but I am glad we went there. Everybody loved it there. Perfect place for those who want to have fun and be close to the action!"

Parking cost for our SUV was $20/ day, but still better than most other places. It's not a fancy place - but a standard hotel at a resonable rate for NYC.

Our room was a good size and we had a sea view but unfortunately no balcony. I think there are only a few rooms that do not have one. Staff are very attentive and came round every day to check if we needed any extra toiletries or water. The pool was closed but we had the use of all the Westin facilities next door. The pool guys would bring you buckets of ice if you wanted to take your own drinks down to the pool and they came round every now and again with cold towels which was great in the 40 degrees heat. We ate in Barasti twice and in Ciros the italian restaurant and found both to be good. There are plenty of sun beds at both the pool and the beach. No need to take towels as the hotel supply you with them. They also give you 30 minutes free use of the computer in the business centre per day I have always wanted to stay at Mina Seyahi and it did not disappoint me."

While the Courtyard rooms are not the Bellagio, I believe for the price they are an excellent value. One thing I really like about the Palace Station is that the pool is open any time. Also the pool is heated and is open in the winter when most other pools are closed. The exercise room is small, however, there is no extra charge. The food at the Palace Station is excellent for the price at any of the restaurants. I just love visiting the Irish pub for a Guinness and the live entertainment."

My room was located on the 17th floor, with a view looking north toward Wynn. I laughed to myself because the first thing that stood out was a great looking bed, with a teddy bear sitting in the middle of it. There were plenty of bars of soap, body wash, shampoo, conditioners, towels, a coffee maker, and even a rubber ducky!!!Pool was small, but never crowded. Didn't realize that they actually cool the water in the pool. There's also a whilpool, which was a nice touch. Service was great... the waitress never let you get thirsty. A small casino, with the blackjack table going every time I looked. Craps table had wagers from $1 to $100, something I do not see too often. Starbucks coffee was really convenient in the morning. Valets were always available, with no waits for my car. A quick walk to the strip, and really easy to get to Ballys across the street."

The continental breakfast was exactly what I expected for the price of the room, not much but the kids liked it and my wife and I liked not having to spend extra. The outside air temperature was over 115 degrees both days we were there and the pool was perfect. Lots of cable channels for the kids to watch. Close enough to the strip that mom and dad could drive there in a few minutes. The hotel felt safe enough to leave the kids (12 and 16) in the pool and room for a few hours in the evening while the parents went the strip. We asked about a good, inexpensive buffet for a late lunch and got a GREAT referral to the Silverton Resort, about a 15 minuted drive south of the strip. We will look at Hampton properties in the years to come!"

Was looking for a hotel with good Christmas decor, swimming pool and overnight parking nearby. San Francisco hotels normally charge over $40 minimum a night for parking. There was Hearst parking next door ($20 for a 24hr period) ; no in-out previleges but was good enough for me and also has a CPK in the same buliding. About 10 minute walk to Bloomingdales and San Francisco Shopping Center. The rooms are nice with LCD HDTV with actual HD channels including HBO. The Christmas decor was very nice in the lobby and the restaurant. Had a traditional European feel to it. Kids loved it. Swimming pool is nice and indoor but the was definitely not warm and a little bit salty, yuk. Kids had fun nonethless, so, apart fron the pool everything else was good. Will probably return for my other kid's birthday."

Not being a fan of Las Vegas I loved being off the strip yet close enough to go in to see a show, go shopping etc. The rooms were gorgeous and spacious. The spa was wonderful and relaxing. The pool area amazing. Plus loved drinks at the firepit outside. It was a great time of year to go - not very crowded at all. Loved the touch of free bottled water at the front desk. My only &quot;issue&quot; and it was not bad is that the way the hotel is set up there is really one main elevator to the rooms and then you have to walk down one long continuous hallway to get to your room. Ours, of course, was almost at the end of the long hall. There is a pool elevator a bit closer. I would definitely return and would easily bring my small children here to enjoy the pool!"

It is in quite a quiet location,but the road can be busy in the morning. The apartments are well appointed with plenty of closet space. There is a good sized room for washing and drying. The car parking is undercover which keeps the cars cool from the sun. The swimming pool area can only be entered by use of the door keys. There is also a good water play area for the children. There is a family pool and hot tub, as well as an adult only pool and hot tub,(closed for the entire week we were there) Unfortunately there is no control over whether children go in the adult only pool. A minibus goes down to the strip, but only at certain times in the early evening. Parking is free at the casinos. There is coffee available in the reception area. A good place to stay."

The hotel staff were all so friendly and helpful and the location was perfect. The hotel lobby is beautiful and the rooms are massive! We stayed on the 16th floor and had views of the city. Not spectacular but still very nice. The television was quite large and I particularly liked the powder room. The room was immaculate and the staff were very quick to respond to our requests. I did not like having to pay for both internet and pool. $10 a day for the internet and an extra $10 a day for the pool/gym area. However the pool area is really nice. It is located indoors and is heated. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in San Francisco near Union Square."

This is a family-friendly establishment with nice rooms, balcony, high-speed wireless, free breakfast, evening reception on weekdays, exceptional pool facility and fitness center, and within walking distance to the strip. To top it off, their prices are amazingly low. Our kids stayed in the pool most of the time because it was extremely hot in Vegas. They also made lots of friends in the pool and left us alone to enjoy. None of us like gambling, but we took a stroll along the strip in the nights to enjoy people and architecture. Kids loved the Adventuredome at circus-circus and hiking in the nearby red rock canyon. Highly recommended for families."

Lots of beds for adults, beach etc etc. Staff friendly and helpful. Food good. We were only B&amp;B and it kept us going until later afternoon.

Was looking for a hotel with good Christmas decor, swimming pool and overnight parking nearby. San Francisco hotels normally charge over $40 minimum a night for parking. There was Hearst parking next door ($20 for a 24hr period) ; no in-out previleges but was good enough for me and also has a CPK in the same buliding. About 10 minute walk to Bloomingdales and San Francisco Shopping Center. The rooms are nice with LCD HDTV with actual HD channels including HBO. The Christmas decor was very nice in the lobby and the restaurant. Had a traditional European feel to it. Kids loved it. Swimming pool is nice and indoor but the was definitely not warm and a little bit salty, yuk. Kids had fun nonethless, so, apart fron the pool everything else was good. Will probably return for my other kid's birthday."

One VERY important element of any of our hotel reservations is that the hotel must have a pool for our kids. Well, we arrive at the Courtyard by Marriott only to be told the pool is closed for renovation. Are you kidding me?? The staff apologized and said that we could use the pool at the Conference Center Marriott (a 10-12 minute walk) for a fee of $10 per person. Are you kidding me?? After stating my displeasure they said they would pay for the Marriott pool fee for us - thanks but no thanks. Why not notify us about the pool renovation in their confirmation email we received just days before our arrival?? This is the second year in a row we had issues with a Courtyard by Marriott hotel - last year we arrived at another Courtyard by Marriott only to find out they gave our room away and had no room for us..."

The pool area is small but well kept and well designed - but be warned, the pool is VERY cold! There are 2 restaurants and a poolside snack bar - we tried all of them and were not disappointed. The food is of good quality, as isnt badly priced considering this is an expensive hotel. Obviously it is cheaper to eat outside the hotel - but definitley give the 'Fire' restaurant a go. Has a great bar too. The staff were lovely to us, nothing was too much trouble and we were always met with smiles!I'd say this was the nicest place we stayed in India - we were there for several weeks all around the northern region and goa."

It was amazing, two king bedrooms, one twin, maids room, and 5 bathrooms. Huge kitchen, dining room, living room and numerous balconies. Hotel was spotless the beds changed nearly everyday. There are only 2 things that I was disappointed with in the Arjaan. The pool area is lovely and has a heated pool, but there are only 20 sunloungers at the pool so if you are not up before 9.30 am all the sunloungers are gone and you have to sit on the grass. Also it was extremely difficult to get a taxi from the front of the hotel at peak times as the entrance is not on the main road and taxis do not pass the hotel entrance. Overall, I had a wonderful time in the Arjaan and would recommend it to friends/family."

All hotel staff was polite from the staff at the check in desk, breakfast staff, cocktail servers at the complimentary reception each evening to the doormen who flagged down a cab for us each day. The location worked great for us. We took cabs to some museums, but this hotel was walking distance to the John Hancock tower, Michigan Avenue, The Art Institute and Navy Pier. You may pay a little extra for Embassy Suites, but with the hot breakfast and the complimentary cocktail reception, you get your money's worth. The pool area was small as is the case with all downtown hotels if they even have a pool, but with our busy schedule, the small pool/hot tub served our purpose at the end of a busy day. Love Chicago and would stay here again."

Get there early is you want to get a lounge chair. The buffet was excellent on both occasions that we dined there. The staff was very friendly and always will to help when asked. We can't wait to come back to Vegas and stay at Mandalay Bay again!"

Although a bit crowded and difficult to get chairs during the midday, the pool was great, large, waterfalls and easily accessible bathrooms. Our room was lovely, although the view was not great, we could see a bit of the volcano show during the night. Internet access was not free, $15 for 24 hours. Our little girl slipped on the bathroom floor and split her lip open. All in all, not super kid-friendly, but do-able with one child or older children. Happy travels."

But the hotel was great, nice room, nice staff, great service, good location..... I also found really good to have free wifi in the room. Gym was one of the biggest I've seen in a hotel. The only disadvantage is that as mentioned in other reviews, this hotel should have a pool designated for adults only. The hotel has 3 pools and the first two days we were fine, but then the last 3 days all 3 pools were invaded by children. Please do not get me wrong, there are children that behave very well and there are adults that behave worse than children, but if you're travelling without children you would prefer to stay away form them :) So the hotel's 3 pools &amp; gardens are big enough to get a designated area for adults. Anyway I would go back to this hotel, and I strongly recommend it."

Lazy river is filled with tons of children not only from mandalay bay but is the destination for many other guests with children from other hotels (non hotel guest are supposed to pay but we watched many families beg the staff and get in for free). Stayed there for 4 days and everyday pool was filled with children from 10 am to 6pm everyday. If you dont get there by 10 am you will not get a chair. There is a European pool for adults if you want to pay $20 a day (staff will try to charge you more $40??)"

Buffet was great but buy at $25 all day pass &amp; save a bunch of money by eating your meals for the day there! The Tournament of Kings show was spectacular and worth the money. Gambling was so-so but enjoyed the walkways and monorail to Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Shopping was great. Only complaint? The time share people are everywhere and hassle you every chance they get! Would love to stay here again. Was so relaxed from the days by the pool that I did not want to leave."

First do not allow mothers to put their diaperless bare naked babies and or small childern into the resort pools. We complained of a mother removing a dirty diaper and washing the babies lower body in the pool while people swam by. The next day the pool was closed due to a biohazard aka poop from another small non potty trainned child in the pool. CHANGE the age limit rules for this resort to children 10 and over with adult supervision. No diapers and no bare botttoms in the pool. This is a severe health hazard. There is no excuse for this classless behavior. Bring back our classy 5 star resort that we love so much. I loved my comfy room. The service was understaffed but, improved after we complained.

Rooms were clean and had everything you could ask for. Beds were comfortable. We had a concern over valet parking but it was never an issue. Tipping was not necessary. Fitness centre was fabalous, could not find any fault with it. Marketplace Food store too pricey but shopping centre was close by. Pool was small and too hot without any shade and too many people in the pool. However, you can use the pools at Planet Holloywood, ask at front desk. Overall, great place, great location and facilities."

It's not on the strip, nor close to the strip, but downtown, which has it is own charms. This is by far the best hotel downtown. The pool is the best one in town. Yes, THE BEST ONE. It does not cover acres with beautiful landscaping like the strip pools, but it has a 3-story waterslide that goes through a shark tank, which you can also swim right next to the tank. It's also heated year round, unlike a lot of the strip pools, so this place becomes an even better deal in the winter. The club has a great balcony that overlooks downtown. Check this place out.

It's a BIG hotel and takes a couple days to get to know your way around. Wave pool - awesome. Get there by 9:30 a.m. to get more than just 2 lounge chairs together. Kids under 48&quot; not allowed in wave pool. $10 drinks at the pool - buckets of beer probably best bang for buck. Lots of great restaurants at the hotel - we ate at these and I'd recommend them all: Strip Steak, House of Blues, and the Sushi restaurant. Happy hour at House of Blues great value. Easy to hop on tram to Luxor and then walk to New York for the roller coaster. Saw Criss Angel's show at Luxor - give it a 7/10. If shopping, taxi to Miracle Mile shops - stop by the Cheeseburger Restaurant and grab a Mai Tai in a big plastic pineapple cup to go!"

Embassy Suites Convention Center was the perfect location - no noisy casino - great cook-to-order breakfast (our son was thrilled and he is picky eater!) and a manager's reception that is a great way to begin an evening! The staff was very helpful, our room was great - no problems. We took the monorail to the strip - right down the street - that can get a little expensive for 3 people - but I'm glad we did it. We had dinner there also &amp; that was very good. The pool and whirlpool were just right for us - not a lot of kids - indoor pool for when it was a little windy out. We had a taxi to the airport inside of 5 minutes - it was great! I highly recommend Embassy Suites Hotel Las Vegas Convention Center! Definitely would stay here again!"

Preschool on up can enjoy floating on the lazt river for hours. The hot tubs are fun for all ages too. Bring your own innertube so you do not need to spend money on renting or buying one at the hotel. The only downside of the hotel is the prices for food. Quite expensive to feed a family of 4 but it is the same at all the nice Vegas hotels. We bought some snacks and beverages at the local drugstore to save money."

No kids menus at any of the hotel restaurants and food at hotel was over priced-- food was good but not great. Access to the gym is $20/day. Breakfast buffet ends at 10:30am sharp. Suggestions:Request a room away from the hotel's expansion project or else you will here construction vehicles honking and backing-up early in the morning. Overall nice hotel and would stay there again and would recommend for families. Weekdays are a lot less crowded."

Location was great everyone was pleasant. Food was not the best, better food all over the strip."

We've been to Montreal countless times and thought this would outdo all other locations. We were wrong. It is geared toward conferences. The pool is a simple pool, whirlpool was not working, hot tub was not hot. The rooms are clean (be sure to reserve one that has been renovated) and the staff are friendly. Food is pricey but again location underground is fine for eating. No simple nightlife when accompanied by a 12 year old. We often travel together and sit and enjoy a drink and music or entertainment or other (even people watch) or discussion with other people but this was not possible at the Fairmont. Nothing to do or see. Piano bar - starts later in the evening - not sure children were allowed in the lounge anyhow."

From check in to the restaurants, most of the staff seemed unhappy and uninterested in helping/providing service. The hotel towels were like rags, and we had to call every day to get enough towels for the people in our room. During the week, the hotel and pool were fine. The worst part of the vacation (we were there for a 50th wedding anniversary), was the drinking and partying in the pool on the weekend. It may be Vegas, but there were so many young people falling down drunk, pouring beer into the pool, smoking and putting their ashes in the pool, and a few even exposing themselves, that we felt like we were in a bad spring break movie. We complained, but the hotel staff did not seem to care about how gross the pool was. If you are traveling with kids, try someplace else."

The location is supurb, central to many of the attractions, on the edge of Covent Garden &amp; the theatre district. Our room overlooked the Lyceum theatre. The hotel is trendy, well decorated, with a few quirky touches, and a good bar. Our room was not overly large, but a decent size for a major city. The bathroom was good, great shower &amp; lovely REN toiletries. The pool area is tiny, and the pool freezing - but this is London, so to have a pool at all is a treat!I liked this hotel a great deal, and would praise the service standards of everyone we encountered working there."

The pool was actually a wading pool, not a lap pool, and the view I actually had was a view of the rusty metal pavilion roof... no pool in sight. Secondly, when I came back to the room after a long day off meetings, looking forward to a long shower, I discovered that they had not only NOT replenished my towels, but left no coffee replacements for the next morning. When I compained of the aforementioned items, i was met with a surly attitude from the front desk, not to mention that they overcharged me by $90 upon checkout. Oh yeah... AND the elevator was broken, so I got to enjoy the service elevator for 2 days.... all in all... a disaster!!!!!!!"

The only thing is I wish they would have a small non-smoking area near these pools for families with children or for adults with medical conditions that would prefer a non-smoking area. The hotel is across the street from the M&amp;M store, the arcade, and the roller coaster in the New York New York, which was perfect for our kids. If you try this hotel and agree with the non-smoking area please let them know so that maybe this will change soon.

However, one of the primary reasons we stay there was because it had a pool and we had two children. The pool, which is in an adjacent health club, only allows children to swim until 6 p.m. weekdays and 8 p.m. weekends. There is also a 15-person limit in the pool, which is about 4 feet deep throughout. On several days, our children were disappointed not to be able to swim after a long day of sightseeing. Otherwise, the hotel is close to the Kilburn Park underground stop on the Bakerloo line. There are several grocery stores nearby, as well as smaller retailers who sell food, candy, beer, etc. It was a good value for the money."

This older hotel gave us a large corner room with two double beds, and views out three windows...one of which was in the bathroom. There was a desk, walk in closet and two armchairs; great for a family. And...it was free with Sheraton points! Prices we've seen for the property seem high; just like all of London. With the tube and theatres just steps away, this central location is a great place to splurge a little or redeem those hotel points. And - to the great joy of our youngest - a gorgeous pool. Be sure to check pool hours...and ask when children can swim. We were not told that only adults are allowed after 8 p.m. until we showed up to swim one evening at 8:30. The desk staff was competant and the conceirge really did not answer the one question we asked, but the door staff was exceptional - helpful, friendly and watchful at all times."

The reason I was prompted to write is that we chose this hotel mainly to use the swimming pool for our children. I'm sure other families will know how difficult it is to find a family hotel with a pool in central London with a limited budget. Our children aged 5 and 4 were in tears as the swimming pool at this hotel was 5 FIVE AND A HALF FEET DEEP all the way round. No shallow end. Not the thing you would expect from a family friendly Novotel. One morning the manager was greeting guests at breakfast and we highlighted our views to him about children that are unable to swim not being able to use to pool at all. His response was &quot;you will have to bring your armbands the next time&quot;.Useless."

The service is prompt, polite and genuine - they really care about the quality of the service. Dining on the resort and in the Souk is varied, both in cuisine and in price range and you will find something you like. The beach is well kept and not too packed with loungers, drinks and food service on the beach is efficient.

Many of the hotels we tried to book were full, but we were able to get a good rate here, which included breakfast. Were I to stay there again, I would go for the rate which includes parking ($27 a day, going rate in the city). The decor is very handsome and the bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, period. The pool is not of resort caliber, but it is well tended, heated and my two boys were happy to splash about after a day in the city. HOWEVER, there is a huge difference in the rooms overlooking the alley as opposed to those by the pool. The noise from the alley kept me awake all night. They were able to offer me a different room for the second night of our stay and it made all the difference in the world. The rooms on the &quot;pool side&quot; are larger and very quiet at night."

The location is great as it is right over the road from the main train station and walking distance to the shops and restuarants. The rooms were a good size and were very clean. The roof garden and swimming pool are amazing - I'd love to go back in the middle of winter to try the heated outdoor pool when there is several feet of snow all around!The bar was lovely and we had a snack one evening that was also very nice - although you pay Hilton prices for the food and drink.

Because of this people start to save seats and crowd the pool early, but unless you're interested in getting up early an laying in the shade it is NOT fun. The pool is also very small and was overrun by kids.2. It is a pretty good walk away from most everything else. This is fine during the day, but after a nice dinner or going to clubs you will not want to make the walk back. And YES you will have to leave NYNY to find a good place to eat, or a good club. Most of the food is pizza, sandwhiches, or hot dogs. There is a good piano bar but because it is really the only decent bar it also gets very crowded very early.3. It was too much money, the rooms at MGM were the same price and lower for a MUCH better hotel. It was also very loud with the rollercoaster going by the rooms."

The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the hotel charges extra to use the workout room--I thought that was a little lame. The pool was free though. We'd stay there again but I would be disappointed if I paid a lot for the room and then couldn't workout."

The pool had to close two days later because the filter gave out. The GO Luxury room was not all it was cracked up to be. The room I had was clean but there was mold in the shower ceiling as well as water damage to the ceiling. The finishing around the bathroom door was not complete and there was water leaking from somewhere near the window onto the carpet. I've never been to Vegas in July but with the crowds and the heat made my trip somewhat a nightmare."

Lots of ammenities. Lots of towels which was great because our teenagers forgot their towels for the pool. The pool is heated which was nice. It had a pool table inside the lounge area which my husband liked. If you do not like all the chaos of the strip than you would love to stay here. We needed some snacks and the good thing is that everything is so close. Target is right down the street. It was a good place especially for the price. And believe me I checked around.

We did have that happen, but it was over after only a few seconds when we said we were not interested. The room was great for us. The price was outstanding. It was about a 10 minute drive to the shows on the strip, but we did not mind that at all. Ton's of space. We did not run into any sound problems with other rooms. Two minor complaints. The leaf blower guy at 7 am.....really are they serious. The pool was so cold. Perhaps when the temp outside it 100+, the cold pool is great, but we were there when the temp was in the 70's and the pool was too cold. Recommend the breakfast at the casino next door. Internet came at a cost."

Overall, the hotel was clean, staff were friendly and the location was great. Unfortunately, we had a few problems. Our room, upon arrival, was very cold and the cable was broken. A custodian came to fix both problems and was successful after several hours of work. My biggest complaint was the pool. The tile appeared dirty and the temperature of the water was very cold. We complained the first day and the staff admitted the heater had been turned down (why?) and that they would increase the temp by the following day. The next day, although it was a bit warmer, it was still too cold for us to swim. Since the pool is my daughter's favorite thing at any hotel, the cold temp really dimished our enjoyment. We will not return to this hotel."

We went specifically so the kids could swim, and the adults could gamble, use the spa and other amenities. We were shocked to learn upon our arrival the pools were closed for annual maintenance. We were not informed of this fact either via direct communication with the resort prior to our arrival or via their website. The resort tried to make it up by providing guest privelages at the other Station Casino in town, but we had to rent a car to get there but the kids had a great time. Otherwise, the resort and casino were exceptionally clean, over-the-top customer service, great kids facility w/ Wii games, basketball, hair and nail salon- they loved it, and the bowling. We would go back but check ahead first about the pools- it was a fluke."

There is also a high-class department store-Xin Kong with world-class brand shop and thousands of commercial brands you can find. If you like shopping, it is very convenient. It is about 4 kilo-meter to the famous San-Li-Tun, i usually spend 16-18 rmb to go there. The receptionist is very kind and patient to give you all the city guide. I like their swimming pool, a bit less then 25m long, but cool design with the heating chair and shower just next to the pool. The sign leading to the pool is not very clear thought, as it is actually share the entrance to the Spa. Overrall it is quite an enjoyrable stay."

The swimming pool is sad, very small. Kids swimming pool was occupied by old ladies. I was getting &quot;oh! kids! in vegas! in the pool while I'm here&quot; kind of looks. Breakfast is a joke. Disgusting coffee (proudly served by Starbucks name), toast, apples. I asked for a cream cheese but they said they give cream cheese only with bagels and bagels were not on the menu that morning. Next time we are in Vegas we will not choose this hotel. There are much better resorts."

Spotless hotel, great service, no smoking, no casino. We thought the kids would enjoy the river pool, so we took a walk over to the MGM Grand. That was a disaster. The pool was dirty (wrappers and cloudy water) and VERY crowded with people (most people in tubes drinking beer). We were very happy to return to the serene pools of the signature! If I go back to vegas for any reason, I'll stay there for sure!"

The king room was a good size for the two of us and the bed was comfortable and pillows soft. The bathroom was clean I always like to see really clean towels which they were. A small downside was that our room (316) was a little too near the elevator and although there was no noise from the elevator itself there was from guests coming and going at early/late hours. Staff made us feel at ease and answered all our enquiries and requests quickly and were very helpful. We ate both breakfast and dinner in the attached Daily Grill and were not disappointed by either the prices or the quality of food served. The pool area is a lovely sun spot and the pool was warm to swim in. Altogether a very nice hotel (Club Section) with helpful and willing staff. Would stay again if visiting the Union Square area again."

The car parking is undercover which keeps the cars cool from the sun. The swimming pool area can only be entered by use of the door keys. There is also a good water play area for the children. There is a family pool and hot tub, as well as an adult only pool and hot tub,(closed for the entire week we were there) Unfortunately there is no control over whether children go in the adult only pool.

The reason I was prompted to write is that we chose this hotel mainly to use the swimming pool for our children. I'm sure other families will know how difficult it is to find a family hotel with a pool in central London with a limited budget. Our children aged 5 and 4 were in tears as the swimming pool at this hotel was 5 FIVE AND A HALF FEET DEEP all the way round. No shallow end. Not the thing you would expect from a family friendly Novotel. One morning the manager was greeting guests at breakfast and we highlighted our views to him about children that are unable to swim not being able to use to pool at all. His response was &quot;you will have to bring your armbands the next time&quot;.Useless."

Hotel was decidedly better than the Jurys in South Kensington...staff were very friendly and helpful - reception area staff commendably so. Room and facilties fine, bar and lounge OK - great location for shops, and competitively priced. Minor gripes about on-going construction work - very minor though. Only real issue was the swimming pool - it is not in the hotel but a Virgin franchise out the back of the hotel (who's staff were hopeless). Given that we booked the hotel to have easy access to a pool (and the pool had very limited access times for children - despite the fact that there was never a lifeguard on duty !) this was a negative. Overall, liked it, would go back and recommend it."

First time in Bellagio this time in the four seasons at Mandalay Bay. The Hotel was fantastic with its own private pool area away from the big groups at Mandalay Bay although you can use both pools. If you have kids Mandalay bay is better as it has a massive pool with wave machine if you are a couple and want peace and quiet the Four seasons every time. The hotel is situated right at the South end of the strip which has it is advantages in that you are out of the way so no really big crowds but makes going up and down the strip a bit longer walk. If you are 20's - 40's you are fine if you are over 60 stay in the middle of the strip to save the legs :-).I would recommend the hotel to anyone, when we go back this would be very high on my list of were to stay but we might try the new Palazzo or Encore as they both looked great hotels when we went and looked at them."

We had a deluxe queen room and had two adults and two teens in the room. It was a little crowded but the beds were very comfortable. We were located in one of the inside rooms on the 9th floor. We had no view, but we had no noise at all to speak of. Air conditioning was perfect as well. We went to the pool every night and my kids really liked it. They call it a 'splash pool' It is about a quarter width of a regular pool and about 2/3 the length. Not good for swimming laps but perfectly adequate for the kids. The only complaints I had were minor--very funky shower that only seemed to work as a hand held. It sprayed across the tub to the towel shelf when it was in it is overhead position. And the Empire is the first hotel I've ever stayed in that did not offer coffee service. I would absolutely go there again!"

This older hotel gave us a large corner room with two double beds, and views out three windows...one of which was in the bathroom. There was a desk, walk in closet and two armchairs; great for a family. And...it was free with Sheraton points! Prices we've seen for the property seem high; just like all of London. With the tube and theatres just steps away, this central location is a great place to splurge a little or redeem those hotel points. And - to the great joy of our youngest - a gorgeous pool. Be sure to check pool hours...and ask when children can swim. We were not told that only adults are allowed after 8 p.m. until we showed up to swim one evening at 8:30. The desk staff was competant and the conceirge really did not answer the one question we asked, but the door staff was exceptional - helpful, friendly and watchful at all times."

Preschool on up can enjoy floating on the lazt river for hours. The hot tubs are fun for all ages too. Bring your own innertube so you do not need to spend money on renting or buying one at the hotel. The only downside of the hotel is the prices for food. Quite expensive to feed a family of 4 but it is the same at all the nice Vegas hotels. We bought some snacks and beverages at the local drugstore to save money."

Great pool scene every night and many people in the pool right up until 11 PM when it closes. The pool is heated to about 85 degrees all the time. Rooms are nice and functional.

The staff is very welcoming (free fruit cocktail) and helpful. There are two pools: one for families and one adult pool. The rooms are in chalet style, but very clean and a gorgeous bathroom - including candles!We had dinner in the restaurant and ordered a ceasar salad for two. The mayonaisse for the salad and the salad itselves was prepared in front of ourselves The waiter only pourred too much oil in the mayonaisse and decided to start all over with fresh ingredients :) I've never seen two people working soo hard on a salad, it is highly recommended!! The wine selection is also excellent and is served at exactly the right temperature. Arround Hatta, there is not that much to see. Of course there are the Hatta Pools, but it is unfortunately full of garbage and grafitti."

We booked up for the Executive Arabian Deluxe, which gave us access to the special lounge where the staff were friendly and attentive. The room was clean and comfortable and I highly recommend this hotel for couples after a quiet stay, but with the added benefit of have plenty of restaurants within a short Abra ride (provided free for guests). Children are catered for though with a special pool area with a more pool entertainment than there is in the main pool. My wife had a birthday whilst she was there and the Hotel even put roses, cake and card in the room, much to our surprise (and delight). Its these little touches that make this such a good hotel. For first time visitors to Dubai, I would certainly recommend this hotel as everything is catered for, making the unfamiliar far more comfortable."

The pool was FULL of kids, which was fine for us, but might be a turn off if you did not have kids.

What you can't find anywhere is that the pool is a lap pool that's really part of a health club. That part I actually knew but the deal breaker was they wanted us to wear swim caps, which they'd be happy to sell us for $3 a piece. Now, playing in a pool with my 9 and 7 year olds wearing swim caps and old people swimming laps was not what I had in mind. Otherwise, the hotel was OK. We stayed at Le Parker Merdien last year.

Check-in at 7pm was a breeze, no lines at all. And Yes, the $20 upgrade trick worked. We were upgraded to the Executive Suite in the Palace Tower. This room was huge. It had 2 bathrooms, a living room, and the bedroom had a sitting area. A television was also in the bathroom mirror. 2 flat screen tvs. We had no compliants other than there was not a view from our room. Went to the pool and encountered tons of construction. There are no heated pools but the lifeguard told us that the new pools will be heated. Great stay"

The outside air temperature was over 115 degrees both days we were there and the pool was perfect. Lots of cable channels for the kids to watch. Close enough to the strip that mom and dad could drive there in a few minutes. The hotel felt safe enough to leave the kids (12 and 16) in the pool and room for a few hours in the evening while the parents went the strip. We asked about a good, inexpensive buffet for a late lunch and got a GREAT referral to the Silverton Resort, about a 15 minuted drive south of the strip. We will look at Hampton properties in the years to come!"

Amazing view via the U shaped window. Very clean rooms. Good bathroom products. Dressing room is neat... THE BAD&gt;The hot tub was broken, windows were broken above the pool area. Pool is very hard to find. Bathrooms are SMALL. If you are going with a loved one, this is NOT a good hotel to have bathroom time together in. There is no balconey so you have no idea how to dress until you get down the 36 floors. No continental breakfast, unless you pay 17$ a head. The pillows were too thin alone, and too high stacked. Far away from anything you want to walk to, except the bell centre. For the money, you are better off elsewhere. i love the Delta!!! it has balconey, breakfast, great pool, cheap parking, its great!"

I had read the reviews on ta and was worried that we were going to have a bad stay. We had such a wonderful experience from start to finish. We were upgraded to a suite in THE hotel and any time we called for towels or needed somthing, they were there within minutes. The pool was fantastic! We took our 8-year-old son with us and he loved it. It was not that crowded and there was no problem finding a chair no matter if we were at the wave pool, lazy river or the reg pool. Parking was very close to hotel entrance, which we loved. Was not able to use the gym ( couldn't bring self up to paying $30/day). Restaurants were very pricey...our tradition is to have the french onion soup at Red, White and Blue b/c it is the best we have ever had! No lines at the elevators! Didn't win on slots, but only lost $5 after playing all week! We love Vegas and LOVED THE hotel!"

Easy check in and employees were very friendly and polite. Got a one bedroom suite for family of 5 and worked out well with youngest on floor. Parents got seperate room and A/C worked great. Quiet and they have lots of great perks like free wash/dry and a little store that was a bargin compared to everything else in Vegas. Suites fully equipped and lots of storage for food if your going to be there several days. Free rental of VHS tapes and a nice pool area with spa. Only dislike was we were up towards the main area and the pool was far to the rear. If you plan on using the pool alot with small kids, request a room above 165/265/365. Will stay again, especially if I can grab another internet deal like this time. You won't touch these rates on the strip on a weekend nite."

Everyone there was very helpful and the hotel is located in a very convenient location in Montreal. It is a brand new hotel and is somewhat trendy and well designed. Several problems came up over our stay. First there were not refrigerators in every room. We order one from the front desk but they were all taken. They put us on a waiting list but we never received a fridge. Also the wireless internet was broken on our floor. We couldn't find any do not disturb signs and were constantly being bothered by the cleaning staff. While there is a pool in the building it is rather small. The heater for the pool was broken during our stay and the general pool area is not all that nice. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again unless I was 100% certain all of these problems were fixed."

The pool with a swimup bar and blackjack was heavily advertised online and when we booked the rooms they never told us it was going to be closed the days we were there. We were told we were supposed to know to ask if the pool was going to be open when we booked the room. They justified not telling us the pool was going to be closed by saying they had another pool and 2 hot tubs open (the open pool was basically a kiddie pool). We ended up having to go to the Excalibur pool to swim. The elevators were out of order. The hallway by our room and the room itself smelled awful. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

The spots on the carpet,the too low lighting in the bathroom, and the lack of free internet service were disappointing, as was the lack of replacement of some of the bath items that were used on the first day. As Las Vegas has tried to get more family friendly, closing the hotel pool at 7pm to get ready for a pool party was family unfriendly.

Many of the hotels we tried to book were full, but we were able to get a good rate here, which included breakfast. Were I to stay there again, I would go for the rate which includes parking ($27 a day, going rate in the city). The decor is very handsome and the bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, period. The pool is not of resort caliber, but it is well tended, heated and my two boys were happy to splash about after a day in the city. HOWEVER, there is a huge difference in the rooms overlooking the alley as opposed to those by the pool. The noise from the alley kept me awake all night. They were able to offer me a different room for the second night of our stay and it made all the difference in the world. The rooms on the &quot;pool side&quot; are larger and very quiet at night."

The extra powder room was invaluable with a teenage daughter. Having the suite accommodated the early riser and the late nighter. The spots on the carpet,the too low lighting in the bathroom, and the lack of free internet service were disappointing, as was the lack of replacement of some of the bath items that were used on the first day. As Las Vegas has tried to get more family friendly, closing the hotel pool at 7pm to get ready for a pool party was family unfriendly. With so little for underage guests to do, the closing of the pool seemed wrong and upset the daughters."

Attentive staff esp if you leave a tip for the housekeepers. The market store in the lobby is good. There was absolutely no pressure to buy time share. Probably best for families with small kids who want to stay away from the casino scene or expose the kids to the crowds there. We ended up getting a studio attached to a one bedroom and it became a two bedroom when the door was openned in between them. Con: noise from construction next door but was not a big deal except when in pool. The swimming pool was not shallow enough for small kids and was split in half . Instead of having a larger pool, there were two smaller ones. Overall, great place to stay with kids and would definitely consider it again."

The room, recently refurbished, was clean and fresh. The bed was very, very comfy. Overall, the room was a little on the small side - I'd call it compact - the bathroom had a shower only and one of those teeny sinks. There was a flat screen TV but no pay-per-view. The pool was a real standout - a large indoor pool, glassed in, with plantings outside - on the fourth floor. Big, warm, clean pool. Nice-looking workout area adjacent. Sunny, with lots of deck chairs, a magazine rack, chess set, etc. Teeny towels, though!Only negative - the free shuttle never showed up and we had to make a mad dash for our &quot;tea&quot; appointment. Taxi fare to the AG place was less than $10 including tip."

Staff was great and facility was well maintained from housekeeping to maintaining the towels at the pool. A minor note...the pool was bit to small for the the people using it... especially since there were several families with multiple children. There was no where to go inside of the pool to avoid the diving and splashing from the kids.. (This not deserving to take away the perfect rating of The Carriage House) Would not hesitate to return!!"

I agree with previous post that the reception staff is not terribly friendly, however the hotel met all our needs, was clean, quiet and a great location. We also walked to and from the hotel and never felt uncomfortable. My only complaint was the pool hours. The days we were there it was 95 and 96 degrees. The pool closed the first day at 8:00 (reason given was that it was &quot;too hot&quot;??) and the second day it closed at 7:00. Other that that, it was well worth the price."

Stayed in Club room - which was worth the extra - free booze and light snacks, although would be great if this included drinks from pool bar during the day (but that is probably asking too much)! The Sea View room only really looked out onto pool - but everything else was faultless. Good price and definitly worth a trip. Sea was unbearably hot to swim in - so had to stick to the 'cooled' pool. The building work behind was visually obvious but not obtrusive, being barely audible. Did the 50 a head afternoon tea at Burj al Arab - kind of worth it for the experience - but would not do it again. Would prefer a stay at the Ritz Carlton to one there. Looking at the photo - the hotel is the 3-4 storey building at base of sky scrapers!definitely one of the jewels of Dubais crown!"
